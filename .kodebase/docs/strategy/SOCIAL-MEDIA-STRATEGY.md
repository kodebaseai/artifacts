# Social Media Strategy: Building Audience for Kodebase

**Owner**: Miguel Carvalho (Personal Account)
**Primary Platform**: X (Twitter)
**Secondary Platform**: LinkedIn
**Strategy**: Build personal brand as expert in AI-native development
**Target Audience**: Solo founders, vibe coders, small engineering teams building with AI

---

## Core Differentiation

**Most #buildingInPublic accounts show WHAT they're building.**
**We show WHY traditional dev workflows are broken and HOW AI-native development is the future.**

### Our Unique Position
- Building the rails for AI-native development (not just another AI coding assistant)
- Dog-fooding our own methodology (every Kodebase PR is AI-written using Kodebase)
- Solving "context decay" (a painful problem every developer feels but few can articulate)

### Content Thesis
"Git as the brain for AI agents" + "How to orchestrate AI developers instead of coding yourself"

---

## X (Twitter) Strategy - PRIMARY FOCUS

### Content Pillars (Rotate Systematically)

**1. Building in Public (40% of content)**
- Show real development progress with Kodebase
- Screenshots of artifact files, PRs, agent outputs
- Metrics: "150 AI-written PRs across 4 models"
- Format: Screenshot + insight thread (3-5 tweets)
- Hook: Start with the problem you solved that day

Example:
```
Just had Claude write 3 PRs in parallel while I was in a meeting.

Here's what I learned about orchestrating AI developers: [thread]

[Screenshot of 3 merged PRs]
```

**2. Hot Takes & Thought Leadership (30%)**
- Provocative statements about AI-native development
- Challenge conventional wisdom
- Position as contrarian expert
- Format: Single bold statement or short thread (2-3 tweets)

Example hot takes:
```
Unpopular opinion: Teaching AI to read your docs is harder than teaching junior devs.

The difference? Junior devs ask questions. AI just hallucinates.

This is why we're building Git as a knowledge layer.
```

```
Most AI coding tools make you faster at the wrong things.

You don't need to write boilerplate faster.

You need to NEVER write boilerplate again.

There's a difference.
```

```
Context decay kills more startups than bad code.

You can refactor code. You can't refactor lost knowledge.
```

**3. Technical Deep-Dives (20%)**
- Break down specific technical decisions
- Share learnings from building Kodebase
- Show domain expertise
- Format: Thread with code snippets/architecture diagrams

Example:
```
How we use Git events to auto-update artifact state (thread)

Problem: AI agents need to know what's in-progress vs completed

Traditional tools: External DB that goes stale

Our approach: Git IS the database [1/7]
```

**4. Personal/Relatable (10%)**
- Solo founder struggles
- Development philosophy
- Behind-the-scenes moments
- Format: Short, authentic observations

Example:
```
Weird realization: I'm spending more time writing acceptance criteria for AI than I ever spent writing user stories for humans.

But the AI actually reads them. 🤷
```

### Posting Schedule

**Minimum viable consistency**: 1 post per day (7/week)
**Optimal**: 2 posts per day (14/week)

**Time investment**:
- Daily: 30-45 minutes (draft + schedule 2-3 posts)
- Weekly batch: 2 hours Sunday (plan content themes for the week)

**Best posting times** (for tech audience):
- Morning: 8-10am PT (when devs start their day)
- Afternoon: 2-4pm PT (when devs procrastinate)

**Use Typefully** to batch-create and schedule posts.

---

### Engagement Strategy (Critical for Growth)

**Reply strategy** (15-20 minutes daily):
- Spend time replying to:
  - Anyone in the AI/dev tools space with <10K followers who posts about AI coding
  - Founders building in your niche (solo devs, AI agents, dev tools)
  - Anyone who engages with your content

**Finding your people**:
- Search: "AI coding assistant", "AI agents", "context decay", "developer tools"
- Follow and engage with: Indie hackers building AI tools, VCs investing in dev tools, AI researchers working on code generation
- Build relationships BEFORE asking for anything

**DON'T**:
- Don't be promotional. Ever.
- Don't ask people to check out Kodebase
- Don't spam replies with generic comments

**DO**:
- Add genuine insight to others' threads
- Share your unique perspective
- Ask thoughtful questions
- Tag people when relevant (sparingly)

### Template Replies (Customize These)

**When someone posts about AI coding:**
> "This resonates. I've been orchestrating Claude to write PRs while I focus on architecture. The shift from 'developer' to 'orchestrator' is wild. What's your biggest challenge with AI-generated code?"

**When someone shares a building in public update:**
> "Love seeing the progress. Quick question: how do you handle context decay when switching between AI sessions? I've been solving this with Git-based knowledge layers - curious how others approach it."

**When someone complains about AI coding tools:**
> "Totally agree. Most AI tools make you faster at the wrong things. The real unlock is structuring your codebase so AI can understand it natively. Have you tried [specific technique related to their problem]?"

---

## LinkedIn Strategy - SECONDARY

LinkedIn is relationship-building, not rapid growth. Different audience, different format.

**Posting cadence**: 2-3 times per week
**Content format**: Longer-form (300-500 words)
**Tone**: More professional, less provocative

### Content Types

**1. Case studies (50%)**
- "How we used AI to write 150 production PRs"
- "Why Git-based knowledge beats traditional docs"
- Structured: Problem → Approach → Results

**2. Industry insights (30%)**
- "The shift from developer to orchestrator"
- "Why context decay is the hidden cost of scale"
- Position as thought leader

**3. Personal journey (20%)**
- "What I learned building an AI-native startup"
- "Lessons from shipping with AI agents"
- Authentic, relatable, human

**Cross-posting rule**: Don't just copy X threads to LinkedIn. Expand them into articles.

---

## Metrics to Track (Weekly Review)

**X**:
- Follower growth (aim for +50-100/month initially)
- Engagement rate (likes + replies per post)
- Profile visits
- Top-performing post themes

**LinkedIn**:
- Connection requests (quality over quantity)
- Post engagement
- DM conversations

**Leading indicators of success**:
- People DMing you asking about Kodebase (without you promoting)

## Immediate Action Items (Next 2 Hours)

### 1. Follow starter accounts
Follow all 14 accounts listed above and add them to "AI Dev Builders" list.

### 2. Reply to these 5 posts TODAY

**Post 1**: https://x.com/BuiltByZach/status/1982925462897865185
> "Love the focus on zero overwhelm. Most AI orchestration tools dump you into complexity hell. Quick question: how do you handle context persistence between agents? I've been solving this with Git-based knowledge layers - curious about your approach."

**Post 2**: https://x.com/heyOnuoha/status/1982194437762555925
> "This is exactly what's needed. The playground approach lets you iterate without deploying. Are you handling knowledge/context management for the agents, or is that on the user? That's been my biggest challenge with agent reliability."

**Post 3**: https://x.com/gordonmattey/status/1955714560301879611
> "This hits hard. The irony: AI tools that save time... create more context switching. I've been building Git as a knowledge layer so AI agents have persistent context. No more re-explaining the stack every session. Sarah needs fewer tools that work together, not more isolated ones."

**Post 4**: https://x.com/MehulKalia_/status/1982742565519868191
> "Day 29 and you're already iterating on feedback. This is the way. Curious: how do you handle the agent's context about the user's preferences/experience across sessions? Does it remember or start fresh each time?"

**Post 5**: https://x.com/pirobuilds/status/1982040342829380095
> "Smart move integrating into existing workflows (Slack/Email) vs forcing a new tool. What's the most common failure mode you're seeing with AI agents? Curious if it's context loss, hallucinations, or integration breaks."

### 3. Draft your first 3 X posts
Schedule these in Typefully for this week (see First Week Content Examples below).

---

## First Week Content Examples

**Monday** (Building in Public):
```
Merged 5 PRs today. I wrote 0 lines of code.

All AI-generated. All production-ready.

Here's my workflow for orchestrating Claude agents: [thread]
```

**Tuesday** (Hot Take):
```
The future of software isn't writing less code.

It's never seeing the code at all.

Your job: Define the outcome. AI does the implementation.

We're closer than you think.
```

**Wednesday** (Technical):
```
Why we store project knowledge in Git instead of a database: [thread]

1. Version control is free
2. No sync issues
3. Works offline
4. Inherits repo permissions

Here's how it works...
```

**Thursday** (Personal):
```
Spent 2 hours debugging why my AI agent kept creating circular dependencies.

Turns out I forgot to implement cycle detection.

The AI was just following instructions perfectly. 😅

This is the job now: catch your own logical bugs before the agent does.
```

**Friday** (Building in Public):
```
Week in numbers:
- 23 PRs merged
- 18 AI-authored
- 0 bugs in production
- 1 existential crisis about my job

The AI-native future is weird but productive.
```

**Saturday** (Thought leadership):
```
Most companies will adopt AI coding assistants.

But if your codebase isn't structured for AI consumption, you'll just get faster garbage.

This is why we're building Kodebase: Git as the knowledge layer for AI agents.
```

**Sunday** (Personal):
```
Taking a break from coding to think about coding.

The meta-level work (methodology, structure, systems) is 10x more leveraged than the code itself.

Build the rails, then let AI run on them.
```

---

## Success Criteria

**30 days**:
- 50-100 new followers on X
- 10+ meaningful conversations with builders
- 3-5 people asking about Kodebase organically

**90 days**:
- 200-300 followers on X
- Regular engagement from 20+ builders in your niche
- 1-2 podcast/newsletter invitations
- People using your terminology in their own posts

**6 months**:
- 500-1000 followers on X
- Recognized in AI dev tools space
- Inbound interest from potential users/investors
- Your ideas being referenced by others

---

## Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 1: Time sink** (spending more time creating content than building)
- Mitigation: Set 45-minute daily timer, strictly enforce

**Risk 2: Audience mismatch** (vibe coders not on X/LinkedIn)
- Mitigation: After 60 days, pivot to Reddit/Discord if no traction

**Risk 3: Burnout** (consistency becomes overwhelming)
- Mitigation: Take 1 week breaks, batch content heavily

**Risk 4: Comparison trap** (watching others with 10K followers)
- Mitigation: Focus on quality of 100 engaged followers, not vanity metrics

---

## Alternative Platforms (If X Doesn't Work)

Your "vibe coder" audience might be more active on:

**Reddit**:
- r/SideProject (sort by New, reply to AI-related posts)
- r/IndieDev
- r/SaaS

**Discord**:
- Indie Hackers Discord
- LangChain Discord
- Replit Discord

**Indie Hackers Platform**:
- Post updates directly on IndieHackers.com
- Engage in "Building in Public" section
- Cross-post X threads there

---

## Review Cadence

- **Daily** (5 min): Quick check on engagement, reply to notifications
- **Weekly** (30 min): Review analytics, adjust content mix
- **Monthly** (1 hour): Deep review of what's working, who's engaging, pivot if needed

---

## Notes

- Only use emojis when they genuinely add value (not forced)
- Never promote Kodebase directly - let people discover it through your expertise
- The goal is to become known as an expert in AI-native development, not as "the Kodebase guy"
- If you pivot from Kodebase, your audience should still find you valuable
