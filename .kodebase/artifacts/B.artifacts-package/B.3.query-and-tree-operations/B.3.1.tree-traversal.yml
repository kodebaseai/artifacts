  summary: >-
    Implement tree traversal operations in QueryService: getTree() to load full artifact hierarchy,
    getChildren(parentId) to get direct children, getAncestors(id) to traverse up the tree,
    and getSiblings(id) to get artifacts at same level. Uses lazy loading and caching for performance.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "getTree() returns hierarchical structure (initiatives → milestones → issues)"
    - "getChildren(parentId) returns direct children only (not grandchildren)"
    - "getAncestors(id) returns array from root to parent (e.g., [A, A.1] for A.1.3)"
    - "getSiblings(id) returns artifacts with same parent"
    - "Lazy loading: only loads artifacts when accessed"
    - "Caching: repeated calls reuse loaded artifacts"
    - "Handles circular references gracefully (throws error)"
    - "Performance: handles 1000+ artifacts in <1 second"
    - "Works with A.9.1 fixtures (real artifact tree)"
    - "90%+ test coverage with performance benchmarks"
