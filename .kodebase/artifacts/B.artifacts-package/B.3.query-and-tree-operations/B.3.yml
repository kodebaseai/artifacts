  summary: >-
    Enable tree traversal, dependency graphs, and filtered queries for status operations.
  deliverables:
    - QueryService with tree operations, dependency graph, and filtered queries
    - Tree traversal algorithms with lazy loading and caching
    - Dependency graph operations (blocked_by, blocking, resolution)
  validation:
    - Tree traversal handles 1000+ artifacts efficiently
    - Dependency graph correctly resolves sibling-only relationships
    - Query filters work with multiple criteria (type, state, assignee)
    - Performance test (validate 1000 artifacts in <1 second) passes
delivery_summary:
  outcome: Query and tree operations enabling artifact hierarchy traversal, dependency graph analysis, filtered searches, and readiness validation for workflow automation.
  delivered:
    - QueryService (93-96% coverage, 63 tests) - tree traversal (getTree, getChildren, getAncestors, getSiblings) + query/filter operations (findByState, findByType, findByAssignee, findByPriority, findArtifacts) with two-level caching
    - DependencyGraphService (96.9% coverage, 34 tests) - dependency analysis with BFS path tracking for circular detection, sibling-only constraint enforcement, and core validator integration
    - ReadinessService (96% coverage, 22 tests) - comprehensive readiness validation with two-stage checking (siblings + full ancestor chain), structured diagnostics, and state machine integration
    - Package totals: 330 tests, 96.21% coverage, ESM-only, zero circular dependencies, performance validated (1000+ artifacts filtered in <100ms with warm cache)
  next: Integrate into B.4 CLI commands for tree queries, dependency analysis, and readiness checks enabling `kodebase status`, `kodebase tree`, and workflow automation
  risks:
    - Two-level caching increases memory footprint for large artifact sets (1000+ artifacts)
    - Readiness validation performs full ancestor chain traversal which could impact performance in deeply nested hierarchies
    - In-memory filtering loads all artifacts before filtering, unsuitable for extremely large repositories (10,000+ artifacts)
