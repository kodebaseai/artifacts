  summary: >-
    Enable tree traversal, dependency graphs, and filtered queries for status operations.
  deliverables:
    - QueryService with tree operations, dependency graph, and filtered queries
    - Tree traversal algorithms with lazy loading and caching
    - Dependency graph operations (blocked_by, blocking, resolution)
  validation:
    - Tree traversal handles 1000+ artifacts efficiently
    - Dependency graph correctly resolves sibling-only relationships
    - Query filters work with multiple criteria (type, state, assignee)
    - Performance test (validate 1000 artifacts in <1 second) passes
