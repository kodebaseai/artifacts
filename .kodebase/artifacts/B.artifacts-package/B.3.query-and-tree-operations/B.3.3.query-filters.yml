  summary: >-
    Implement query and filter operations: findByState(state) to filter by current state,
    findByType(type) for initiatives/milestones/issues, findByAssignee(assignee), findByPriority(priority),
    and findArtifacts(criteria) for complex multi-criteria queries. Supports combinations and sorting.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "findByState(state) returns artifacts in specific state (draft, in_progress, completed, etc.)"
    - "findByType(type) filters by artifact type (initiative, milestone, issue)"
    - "findByAssignee(assignee) returns artifacts assigned to specific person"
    - "findByPriority(priority) filters by priority level"
    - "findArtifacts(criteria) supports multiple filters combined (e.g., state + assignee)"
    - "Query results can be sorted by ID, priority, or timestamp"
    - "Supports pagination for large result sets (offset, limit)"
    - "Returns empty array for no matches (not null or error)"
    - "Performance: filters 1000+ artifacts in <100ms"
    - "90%+ test coverage with complex query combinations"
