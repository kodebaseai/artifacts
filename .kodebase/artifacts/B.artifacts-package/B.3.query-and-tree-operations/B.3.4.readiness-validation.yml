  summary: >-
    Implement ReadinessService with comprehensive readiness validation: isReady(id) checks if artifact
    is ready to work on (no incomplete blocking siblings + parent completed if in ready state),
    getReadyArtifacts() returns all artifacts ready to work on, getBlockingReasons(id) explains why
    artifact is not ready, and canTransitionToInProgress(id) validates ready→in_progress transition.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "isReady(id) returns true only if no incomplete blocking siblings exist"
    - "isReady(id) checks parent completion ONLY if artifact already has ready event"
    - "getReadyArtifacts() returns all artifacts ready to work on (filtered by isReady)"
    - "getBlockingReasons(id) returns array of blocking reasons (incomplete deps, incomplete parent, wrong state)"
    - "canTransitionToInProgress(id) validates artifact can transition from ready to in_progress"
    - "Integrates with DependencyGraphService for sibling dependency checks"
    - "Integrates with QueryService for parent traversal"
    - "Integrates with state machine from core for state validation"
    - "Handles missing artifacts gracefully (returns appropriate errors)"
    - "Performance: checks readiness for 100+ artifacts in <100ms"
    - "Works with A.9.1 fixtures (real artifact tree)"
    - "90%+ test coverage with state transition scenarios"
