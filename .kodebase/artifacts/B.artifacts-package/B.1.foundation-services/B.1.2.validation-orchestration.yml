  summary: >-
    Implement ValidationService orchestrating all four core validators (schema, readiness, state machine, dependency)
    into unified pipeline. Includes validateArtifact(artifact), validateAll(artifacts[]) with batch optimization,
    and delegation to core validators with aggregated results.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "validateArtifact() returns { valid: boolean, errors: [], warnings: [] }"
    - "All four validators called in correct order"
    - "Results aggregated into single ValidationResult"
    - "Errors include artifact context (ID, field path, suggested fix)"
    - "Schema errors formatted with field paths and suggestions"
    - "Dependency errors reference actual artifact IDs"
    - "Readiness checks detect missing required relationships"
    - "Batch validation reuses tree loading (no redundant disk I/O)"
    - "Integration test with A.9.1 fixtures catches real violations"
    - "90%+ test coverage with mocked and real validators"
