  summary: >-
    Implement ArtifactService with CRUD operations: createArtifact(artifact, slug), getArtifact(id),
    updateMetadata(id, updates), and appendEvent(id, event). Includes proper directory structure handling,
    YAML serialization, and path resolution helpers.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "ArtifactService creates all 3 artifact types with proper directory structure"
    - "Reads existing artifacts from A.9.1 fixtures without errors"
    - "Metadata updates preserve events array (no overwrites)"
    - "Event appending maintains immutability"
    - "Handles missing files gracefully (throws ArtifactNotFoundError)"
    - "YAML formatting matches core package conventions"
    - "90%+ test coverage on all methods"
