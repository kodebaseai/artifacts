  summary: >-
    Create runnable example scripts demonstrating how CLI package will use @kodebase/artifacts.
    Examples cover kodebase add, validate, and status command flows using all 5 services.
    Serves as reference implementation for Initiative C (CLI Package).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Example: kodebase add workflow (ContextService → ScaffoldService → ArtifactService)"
    - "Example: kodebase validate workflow (ValidationService → error formatting)"
    - "Example: kodebase status workflow (QueryService → tree traversal → filtering)"
    - "Examples use TypeScript with proper imports from @kodebase/artifacts"
    - "Each example is self-contained and runnable via tsx/ts-node"
    - "Examples include error handling patterns"
    - "Code demonstrates best practices (async/await, error boundaries)"
    - "Examples compile successfully with no type errors"
    - "README references these examples in usage section"
    - "Examples serve as starting point for CLI implementation (Initiative C)"
