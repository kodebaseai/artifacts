  summary: >-
    Implement ContextService with detectContext() to infer artifact level and parent from current directory path,
    detectFromBranch() to parse artifact ID from git branch name following Kodebase conventions (add/*, artifact-id, complete/*),
    and getParentContext() to resolve parent artifact. Works from project root (where AI agents and developers operate).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "detectContext() returns { level, parentId } from directory path"
    - "Detects initiative context from .kodebase/artifacts/A.slug/"
    - "Detects milestone context from .kodebase/artifacts/A.slug/A.1.slug/"
    - "Detects issue context from .kodebase/artifacts/A.slug/A.1.slug/A.1.1.slug/"
    - "detectFromBranch() parses 'add/A.1.3' → returns A.1.3 context"
    - "detectFromBranch() parses 'A.1.3' (implementation branch) → returns A.1.3 context"
    - "detectFromBranch() parses 'complete/A.1' → returns A.1 context"
    - "getParentContext() loads parent artifact metadata"
    - "Handles missing .kodebase/ gracefully (throws NotInKodebaseProjectError)"
    - "90%+ test coverage with fixture-based path and branch tests"
