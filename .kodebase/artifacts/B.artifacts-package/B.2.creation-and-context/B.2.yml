  summary: >-
    Enable artifact creation with context awareness and auto-allocated IDs.
  deliverables:
    - ContextService with context detection from path, branch, and directory
    - ScaffoldService with template generation and ID allocation
    - ID allocation logic (A→Z→AA for initiatives, numeric for milestones/issues)
  validation:
    - Context detection works from directory path and branch name
    - Scaffolding creates valid artifacts in draft state
    - ID allocation increments correctly without duplicates
    - Integration test (add initiative → add milestone → add issue) passes
