  summary: >-
    Enable artifact creation with context awareness and auto-allocated IDs.
  deliverables:
    - ContextService with context detection from path, branch, and directory
    - ScaffoldService with template generation and ID allocation
    - ID allocation logic (A→Z→AA for initiatives, numeric for milestones/issues)
  validation:
    - Context detection works from directory path and branch name
    - Scaffolding creates valid artifacts in draft state
    - ID allocation increments correctly without duplicates
    - Integration test (add initiative → add milestone → add issue) passes
delivery_summary:
  outcome: Context-aware artifact creation services enabling CLI commands to scaffold initiatives/milestones/issues with auto-allocated IDs, generated slugs, and git-based actor detection.
  delivered:
    - ContextService (96.7% coverage, 113 tests) - context detection from paths and git branches
    - IdAllocationService (97.32% coverage, 29 tests) - base-26 initiative IDs, numeric milestone/issue IDs
    - Template utilities (100% coverage, 44 tests) - slug generation plus scaffold function re-exports
    - ScaffoldingService (100% coverage, 20 tests) - orchestration layer with unified scaffolding API
    - Package totals: 206 tests, 97.5% coverage, ESM-only, zero circular dependencies
  next: Integrate into B.3 CLI commands for `kodebase add initiative/milestone/issue` workflows
  risks:
    - Git config required for actor detection (falls back to "Unknown User" when unavailable)
    - Agent actor format deferred - only supports human format "Name (email@example.com)"
    - Filesystem-dependent ID allocation unsuitable for pure in-memory scenarios
