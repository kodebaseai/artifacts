  summary: >-
    Implement performance benchmarks to ensure package meets scalability requirements.
    Tests with 1000+ artifacts to validate tree traversal, validation, and query operations
    complete within acceptable timeframes. Uses Vitest bench for consistent measurements.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Tree traversal benchmark: 1000+ artifacts in <1 second"
    - "Validation benchmark: validate 1000 artifacts in <1 second"
    - "Query benchmark: filter 1000+ artifacts in <100ms"
    - "ID allocation benchmark: scan 100+ artifacts in <100ms"
    - "Dependency graph benchmark: resolve chain for 100+ artifacts in <100ms"
    - "Benchmarks run with realistic artifact distribution (initiatives/milestones/issues)"
    - "Performance regression tests fail if benchmarks exceed thresholds"
    - "Benchmark results logged to CI for tracking over time"
    - "Memory usage stays within acceptable limits (no leaks)"
    - "All benchmarks passing with margin for variation"
