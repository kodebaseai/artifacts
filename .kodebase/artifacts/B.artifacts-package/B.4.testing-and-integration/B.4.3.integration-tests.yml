  summary: >-
    Implement integration tests using real A.9.1 artifacts-tree fixtures from @kodebase/core.
    Tests full workflows: create → validate → query, scaffolding → creation, context detection → scaffolding.
    Verifies services work together correctly with real artifact data.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Uses A.9.1 artifacts-tree fixtures as test data (real artifact structure)"
    - "Tests create → validate → query workflow end-to-end"
    - "Tests scaffolding → validation → creation workflow"
    - "Tests context detection → scaffolding → ID allocation workflow"
    - "Validates dependency graph operations with real relationships"
    - "Tests tree traversal with nested artifact hierarchies"
    - "Verifies error formatting with real validation failures"
    - "All integration tests use real filesystem (temp directories)"
    - "Tests clean up temporary files after completion"
    - "All integration tests passing with real core validators"
