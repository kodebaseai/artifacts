  vision: >-
    Ship high-level artifact operations package bridging @kodebase/core and CLI,
    enabling batteries-included workflows for creation, validation, and querying.
  in_scope:
    - Five service modules (Artifact, Validation, Context, Scaffold, Query)
    - Unified validation pipeline orchestrating core validators
    - Context-aware scaffolding with auto-allocated IDs
    - Tree traversal and dependency graph operations
    - Comprehensive error formatting
    - 90%+ test coverage with integration tests
    - JSDoc documentation (95%+ coverage)
  out_of_scope:
    - Git operations (CLI responsibility)
    - Network/API calls (future cloud sync)
    - AI/intelligence features (premium-only)
    - Multi-repository operations
    - Migration/refactoring tools
  success_criteria:
    - All 5 services implemented and tested
    - Unified validation pipeline (schema + readiness + state machine)
    - Context detection from directory and branch name
    - Query operations handle 1000+ artifacts in <1 second
    - CLI package (Initiative C) can consume this API
