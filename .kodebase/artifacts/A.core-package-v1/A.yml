  vision: >-
    Ship a minimal, robust core engine for artifacts, validation, and cascades
    to power MVP flows (new repo bootstrap and adding work in ongoing projects).

    artifact discovery/IO, and wizard-enabling helpers as defined in the core spec.
  success_criteria:
    - Validates and parses v1 artifacts at scale
    - Sibling-only dependency rules enforced
    - Upward cascade recommendations implemented
    - CLI integrates create/start/status/validate using this API
