  vision: >-
    Ship a minimal, robust core engine for artifacts, validation, and cascades
    to power MVP flows (new repo bootstrap and adding work in ongoing projects).
  scope: >-
    Implement parser, validator, readiness rules, state machine, upward cascades,
    artifact discovery/IO, and wizard-enabling helpers as defined in the core spec.
  success_criteria:
    - Validates and parses v1 artifacts at scale
    - Sibling-only dependency rules enforced
    - Upward cascade recommendations implemented
    - CLI integrates create/start/status/validate using this API
impact_summary:
  outcome: "Production-ready artifact management engine shipped, enabling CLI-driven workflows for distributed teams managing work across repositories"
  benefits:
    - "Zero-to-production: complete core engine (26 modules, 97% coverage) in 9 milestones"
    - "Developer velocity: 12 curated API modules with 95% JSDoc coverage reduce integration friction"
    - "Quality foundation: 349 tests with deterministic CI validation catch regressions pre-merge"
    - "Type-safe workflows: comprehensive schemas validate artifacts at scale with actionable errors"
  evidence:
    - "56 PRs merged across A.1-A.9 milestones"
    - "@kodebase/core@0.5.0 published with ESM build, smoke tests, CI integration"
    - "Coverage: 97% statements, 100% functions, 88% branches"
  next: "Enable CLI package (Initiative B) to consume core API for create/validate/start/status commands, unlocking end-to-end artifact workflows"
