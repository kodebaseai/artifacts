  summary: >-
    Ensure that for every relationship pair, `A.blocks` contains `B` iff `B.blocked_by`
    contains `A`, and that all referenced IDs exist and obey sibling/same-parent rules.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Non-existent references are rejected with a clear error code and field path'
    - 'Reciprocity check: for each A→B in blocks, B must list A in blocked_by (and vice versa)'
    - 'Violations reported once per pair with actionable messages; no duplicate noise'
    - 'Validator runs after same-parent/sibling filters to avoid cascade errors'
