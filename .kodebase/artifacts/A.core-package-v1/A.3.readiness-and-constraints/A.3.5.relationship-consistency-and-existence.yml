  summary: >-
    Ensure that for every relationship pair, `A.blocks` contains `B` iff `B.blocked_by`
    contains `A`, and that all referenced IDs exist and obey sibling/same-parent rules.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Non-existent references are rejected with a clear error code and field path'
    - 'Reciprocity check: for each A→B in blocks, B must list A in blocked_by (and vice versa)'
    - 'Violations reported once per pair with actionable messages; no duplicate noise'
    - 'Validator runs after same-parent/sibling filters to avoid cascade errors'
implementation_notes:
  result: "Relationship consistency validator ensures existence and reciprocity with single-issue reporting."
  tags: [core, validation, dependencies]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Avoiding duplicate error messages when both sides of a relationship were inconsistent."
      solution: "Tracked reported pairs with an order-independent key so reciprocity errors surface once per relationship."
    - challenge: "Needing parser-derived artifacts while forcing malformed relationships in tests."
      solution: "Used parser spies to inject tailored relationship data, keeping validator tests isolated from parsing logic."
  insights:
    - "Consistency checks work best after same-parent filters, so the validator now focuses purely on existence and reciprocity."
    - "Fixture-style maps make it straightforward to model missing targets versus mismatched pairs without adding YAML fixtures."
