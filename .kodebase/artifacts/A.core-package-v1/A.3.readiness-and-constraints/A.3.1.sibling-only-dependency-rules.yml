  summary: >-
    Implement enforcement that dependencies only exist among siblings at the same level
    (initiative↔initiative, milestone↔sibling milestone within same initiative,
    issue↔sibling issue within the same milestone).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Validator rejects non-sibling dependencies with a clear error code and field path
    - Initiative deps restricted to initiatives only
    - Milestone deps restricted to milestones under the same initiative
    - Issue deps restricted to issues under the same milestone
  implementation_notes:
    result: "Validator now enforces sibling-only dependencies with explicit artifactId-aware checks"
    tags:
      - core
      - validation
      - dependencies
    challenges:
      - challenge: "Relationships lacked artifact context, making sibling checks impossible"
        solution: "Introduced artifactId option and sibling-check helper keyed off parsed ID parts"
      - challenge: "Coverage missed branch paths for invalid IDs and mismatched parents"
        solution: "Expanded validator test suite with invalid YAML and cross-level relationship cases"
    insights:
      - "Artifact validators must receive the artifact ID whenever relationships exist"
      - "Sibling validation should short-circuit on first invalid reference to keep errors targeted"
