    Implement enforcement that dependencies only exist among siblings at the same level
    (initiative↔initiative, milestone↔sibling milestone within same initiative,
    issue↔sibling issue within the same milestone).
  acceptance_criteria:

    - Initiative deps restricted to initiatives only
    - Milestone deps restricted to milestones under the same initiative
    - Issue deps restricted to issues under the same milestone
