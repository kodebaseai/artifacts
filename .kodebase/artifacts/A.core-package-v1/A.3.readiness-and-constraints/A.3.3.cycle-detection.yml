  summary: >-
    Detect circular dependencies across artifacts by traversing the blocked_by graph
    and reporting cycles with the exact path for debugging.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - DFS-based or equivalent detection reports cycles with an ordered artifact path
    - No false positives on DAG structures; handles disconnected graphs
    - Clear error code and message for cycles; unit tests included
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added graph-based cycle detection that reports ordered dependency loops with deterministic messaging."
  tags: [core, validation, dependencies]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Needed to avoid false positives when artifacts reference siblings that were not included in the validation map."
      solution: "Filtered dependencies to the known artifact set before traversal so external references are ignored without aborting the search."
    - challenge: "Ensuring reusable API surface for downstream tooling while keeping parity with legacy readiness behaviour."
      solution: "Exposed detectCircularDependencies independently and through ArtifactValidator to mirror previous ergonomics."
    - challenge: "Coverage gaps left the missing-node and unknown-dependency branches unverified."
      solution: "Augmented unit tests to simulate absent artifacts and stale map state so defensive guards stay covered."
  insights:
    - "Providing both the raw cycle list and formatted message keeps consumer UX simple without sacrificing machine readability."
    - "Sharing traversal state via visited/inStack mirrors classic DFS and guarantees we only surface unique cycles."
    - "Unit tests that exercise error-path branches help prevent regressions when the validator integrates into readiness flows."
