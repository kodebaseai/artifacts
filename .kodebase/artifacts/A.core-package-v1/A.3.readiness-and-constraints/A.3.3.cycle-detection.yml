  summary: >-
    Detect circular dependencies across artifacts by traversing the blocked_by graph
    and reporting cycles with the exact path for debugging.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - DFS-based or equivalent detection reports cycles with an ordered artifact path
    - No false positives on DAG structures; handles disconnected graphs
    - Clear error code and message for cycles; unit tests included
