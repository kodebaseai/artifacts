    Ensure milestone dependencies are limited to milestones within the same initiative (A.X ↔ A.*),
    and issue dependencies are limited to issues within the same milestone (A.X.Y ↔ A.X.*)
    using ID prefix comparisons.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Validator checks ID prefixes to assert same-parent relationships
    - Violations produce specific error codes and actionable messages
    - Unit tests cover valid and invalid same-parent scenarios
