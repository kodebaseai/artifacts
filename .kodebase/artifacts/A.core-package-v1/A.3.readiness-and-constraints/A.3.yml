  summary: >-
    Implement readiness validation per type and enforce sibling-only
    dependencies with same-parent constraints and graph safety checks.
  deliverables:
    - Sibling-only dependency rules (initiative↔initiative, milestone↔sibling milestone, issue↔sibling issue)
    - Same-parent enforcement for milestones and issues (ID prefix matching)
    - Cycle detection over relationships.blocked_by
    - Cross-level dependency detection with clear error codes
  validation:
    - Invalid dependencies rejected with explicit error codes and fields
    - Cycle detection surfaces the cycle path for debugging
    - Tests and fixtures covering same-parent enforcement and cross-level rejections
