  summary: >-
    Implement readiness validation per type and enforce sibling-only
    dependencies with same-parent constraints and graph safety checks.
  deliverables:
    - Sibling-only dependency rules (initiative↔initiative, milestone↔sibling milestone, issue↔sibling issue)
    - Same-parent enforcement for milestones and issues (ID prefix matching)
    - Cycle detection over relationships.blocked_by
    - Cross-level dependency detection with clear error codes
  validation:
    - Invalid dependencies rejected with explicit error codes and fields
    - Cycle detection surfaces the cycle path for debugging
    - Tests and fixtures covering same-parent enforcement and cross-level rejections
delivery_summary:
  outcome: "Readiness validation now ensures relationships are sibling-only, cycle-free, cross-level safe, and reciprocal."
  delivered:
    - Same-parent relationship validator with structured error codes and parser-backed tests.
    - Cross-level dependency detection helpers and fixtures ensuring only sibling references pass.
    - Cycle detection utility emitting deterministic cycle paths with coverage for defensive branches.
    - Relationship consistency checks that flag missing artifacts and non-reciprocal pairs once per relationship.
  next: "Roll the validation helpers into CLI workflows and monitor for additional artifact rules in A.4."
