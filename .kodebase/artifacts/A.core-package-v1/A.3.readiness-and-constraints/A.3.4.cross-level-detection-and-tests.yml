  summary: >-
    Reject cross-level dependencies (e.g., issue → initiative, milestone → initiative),
    and provide comprehensive tests and fixtures covering valid/invalid patterns.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Validator emits specific error codes for cross-level references
    - Fixture set includes valid sibling-only cases and invalid cross-level cases
    - Integration tests assert rejections with clear messages and fields
implementation_notes:
  result: "Cross-level dependency detection added to the core validator with fixture-backed tests."
  tags: [core, validation, dependencies]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Needed to reuse parser outputs while injecting malformed relationships for targeted assertions."
      solution: "Used spies to replace parser results inside tests, ensuring the validator exercised invalid ID branches without duplicating parser logic."
    - challenge: "Validator reported only generic messages for unparseable IDs by default."
      solution: "Updated relationship checks to surface explicit RELATIONSHIP_INVALID_ID codes and hints before jumping to type-specific validation."
  insights:
    - "Fixture graphs let dependency tests stay readable while exercising multi-node scenarios like sibling-only vs. cross-level."
    - "Mocking parser helpers keeps validation tests focused on relationship rules and reduces maintenance overhead."
