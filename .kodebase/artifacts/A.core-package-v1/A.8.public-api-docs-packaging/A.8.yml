  summary: >-
    Finalize the core’s public surface, documentation, and packaging so that it
    is easy to consume and tree-shake.
  deliverables:
    - Curated index.ts exports (remove non-MVP surfaces)
    - README and docs aligned with actual exports
    - Clean ESM build and type declarations
  validation:
    - CLI consumes stable surface without workarounds
    - Docs match exports; smoke tests pass for ESM imports and d.ts
