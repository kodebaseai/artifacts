  summary: >-
    Audit and expose only the MVP surface from @kodebase/core, removing non-MVP
    modules (IDs/correlation, cleanup/batch, metrics, query) from the public exports.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'index.ts exports match the spec public API surface'
    - 'Non-MVP modules are not exported and remain internal or removed'
    - 'Tree-shaking works on consumer builds (no unused exports pulled)'
