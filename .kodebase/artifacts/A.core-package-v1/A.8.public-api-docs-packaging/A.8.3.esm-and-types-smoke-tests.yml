  summary: >-
    Add smoke tests to ensure ESM consumers can import curated exports and that
    generated type declarations are correct and complete.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Minimal consumer project can import from @kodebase/core without bundler hacks'
    - 'd.ts files contain the public API types; no missing/any typings'
    - 'CI runs smoke tests as part of the core build pipeline'
