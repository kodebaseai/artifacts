  summary: >-
    Enforce that EventBuilder requires an explicit `trigger` (no fallback) and
    provide convenience helpers createDraftEvent/createReadyEvent.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Builder throws error when `trigger` is missing
    - Helpers generate valid events with the correct triggers and ISO timestamps
    - Unit tests cover required-trigger behavior and helper outputs
implementation_notes:
  result: >-
    Implemented `createEvent` with explicit trigger enforcement and added a
    strict event↔trigger compatibility guard via `EVENT_TRIGGER_BY_EVENT` and
    `assertEventTrigger`. Added convenience creators (`createDraftEvent`,
    `createReadyEvent`, `createBlockedEvent`, `createInProgressEvent`,
    `createInReviewEvent`, `createCompletedEvent`, `createCancelledEvent`,
    `createArchivedEvent`). `createBlockedEvent` normalizes
    `metadata.blocking_dependencies` and validates ISO `resolved_at`. All
    builders emit ISO UTC seconds timestamps and use `CEventTrigger` constants.
  tags: [core, state-machine, events, builder]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Preventing silent trigger mismatches while keeping triggers explicit"
      solution: "Added `EVENT_TRIGGER_BY_EVENT` + `assertEventTrigger(event, trigger)` and call it inside `createEvent`."
    - challenge: "Consistent trigger usage across tests and helpers"
      solution: "Refactored tests to assert against `CEventTrigger` constants and removed `any` casts in metadata checks."
  insights:
    - "One constructor + explicit guard keeps API surface small without sacrificing safety."
    - "Typed helper metadata (e.g., for blocked) reduces caller mistakes and aids validation."
