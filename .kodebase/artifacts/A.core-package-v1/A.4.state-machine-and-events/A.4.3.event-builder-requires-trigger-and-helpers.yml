  summary: >-
    Enforce that EventBuilder requires an explicit `trigger` (no fallback) and
    provide convenience helpers createDraftEvent/createReadyEvent.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Builder throws error when `trigger` is missing
    - Helpers generate valid events with the correct triggers and ISO timestamps
    - Unit tests cover required-trigger behavior and helper outputs
