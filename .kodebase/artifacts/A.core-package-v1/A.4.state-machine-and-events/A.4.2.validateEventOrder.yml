  summary: >-
    Enforce chronological ordering of events per artifact, ensuring the first event
    is draft and subsequent events are in non-decreasing timestamp order.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - First event must be `draft`, otherwise validation fails with a specific error code
    - Events must be in chronological (non-decreasing) order; out-of-order sequences are rejected
    - Error messages include the offending timestamps to aid debugging
