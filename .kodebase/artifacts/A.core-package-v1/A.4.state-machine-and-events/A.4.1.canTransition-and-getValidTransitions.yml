  summary: >-
    Define legal state transitions per artifact type (initiative, milestone, issue)
    and expose canTransition/getValidTransitions utilities consistent with the spec.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Transition maps cover all states (draft, ready, blocked, in_progress, in_review, completed, cancelled, archived)
    - canTransition returns true only for legal transitions; false otherwise
    - getValidTransitions returns an ordered, de-duplicated list of next states
    - Clear errors/messages are available for illegal transitions in validators
implementation_notes:
  result: "State machine utilities implemented per artifact type with ordered transitions, exported via @kodebase/core, and covered by tests."
  tags: [core, state-machine, transitions, validation]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Guaranteeing full coverage of states across all artifact types"
      solution: "Centralized transition map and a test asserting the map keys equal ARTIFACT_EVENTS for each type."
    - challenge: "Returning ordered, de-duplicated next states"
      solution: "Iterate with a Set guard to preserve insertion order while removing duplicates."
    - challenge: "Providing actionable errors for illegal transitions"
      solution: "Introduced assertTransition and a StateTransitionError that includes validTransitions and a descriptive message; added tests to verify content."
    - challenge: "Ensuring discoverability in downstream tooling"
      solution: "Exported APIs from src/index.ts and updated the core README; added a changeset for release notes."
  insights:
    - "Transition maps should remain type-specific but structurally uniform to simplify validation and UI logic."
    - "Tests that assert coverage against canonical constants prevent drift when states evolve."
