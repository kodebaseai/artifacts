  summary: >-
    Define legal state transitions per artifact type (initiative, milestone, issue)
    and expose canTransition/getValidTransitions utilities consistent with the spec.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Transition maps cover all states (draft, ready, blocked, in_progress, in_review, completed, cancelled, archived)
    - canTransition returns true only for legal transitions; false otherwise
    - getValidTransitions returns an ordered, de-duplicated list of next states
    - Clear errors/messages are available for illegal transitions in validators
