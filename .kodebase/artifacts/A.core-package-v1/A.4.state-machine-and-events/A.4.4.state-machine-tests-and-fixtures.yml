  summary: >-
    Add unit tests and golden fixtures for state transitions, chronology validation,
    and event builder behavior across all artifact types.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Valid and invalid transition sequences covered per artifact type
    - Chronology validation tests include edge cases (equal timestamps, out-of-order)
    - Builder helper tests confirm triggers and timestamps; CI runs green
