  summary: >-
    Introduce root-level schemas for stakeholder and developer completion fields
    across artifacts: impact_summary (Milestones/Initiatives), implementation_notes (Issues),
    and a shared notes field. Align shapes with artifacts spec for concise, high-signal content.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Define Zod schemas for root-level fields: impact_summary (M/I), implementation_notes (Issues), and notes
    - Keep content schemas unchanged; fields live at the artifact root, not inside content or events
    - Provide minimal helpers/types for consumers to detect presence and shape
    - Add unit tests covering valid/invalid examples
