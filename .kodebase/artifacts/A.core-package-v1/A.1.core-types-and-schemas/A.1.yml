  summary: >-
    Define v1 constants, triggers, and artifact/event schemas; ensure strict
    validation of initiative, milestone, and issue documents with tests.
  deliverables:
    - v1 constants and triggers (states, priorities, estimation, parent_completed, parent_archived, manual_cancel)
    - Actor schema and eventMetadata schema (required trigger, ISO-8601 timestamp)
    - Relationships and artifactMetadata schemas (no fan-out persistence)
    - Initiative, milestone, and issue schemas (flexible acceptance_criteria)
    - Schema tests and golden fixtures
  validation:
    - Schemas validate example artifacts and reject invalid structures
    - Event record matches core spec fields and constraints
    - Trigger catalogue includes parent_completed, parent_archived, manual_cancel
