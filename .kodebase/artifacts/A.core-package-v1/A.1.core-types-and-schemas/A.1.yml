  summary: >-
    Define v1 constants, triggers, and artifact/event schemas; ensure strict
    validation of initiative, milestone, and issue documents with tests.
  deliverables:
    - v1 constants and triggers (states, priorities, estimation, children_started, children_completed, parent_completed, parent_archived, manual_cancel)
    - Actor schema and eventMetadata schema (required trigger, ISO-8601 timestamp)
    - Relationships and artifactMetadata schemas (no fan-out persistence)
    - Initiative, milestone, and issue schemas (flexible acceptance_criteria)
    - Schema tests and golden fixtures
  validation:
    - Schemas validate example artifacts and reject invalid structures
    - Event record matches core spec fields and constraints
    - Trigger catalogue includes children_started, children_completed, parent_completed, parent_archived, manual_cancel
delivery_summary:
  outcome: Core schema stack shipped with registry coverage and passing test suite, enabling downstream adoption work.
  delivered:
    - Published v1 constants, triggers, and artifact type enumerations consumed by all registries.
    - Locked actor, event, relationships, and metadata schemas with strict validation and actionable errors.
    - Completed artifact content and completion field schemas across initiative, milestone, and issue types.
    - Backfilled golden fixtures plus registry and compose-level tests, reaching 100% coverage in @kodebase/core.
  next: Coordinate with A.2 to integrate the schemas into CLI/tooling pipelines and document upgrade guidance for consumers.
  risks:
    - Downstream packages still using legacy schema helpers need migration support to avoid validation regressions.
