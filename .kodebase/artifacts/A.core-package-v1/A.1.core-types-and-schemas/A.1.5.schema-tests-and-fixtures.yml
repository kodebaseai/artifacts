  summary: >-
    Consolodite the Artifact global schema. Create unit tests for schemas and provide golden fixtures for valid and invalid
    artifacts across initiative, milestone, and issue types.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Tests verify required fields, optional sections, and error messages
    - Golden fixtures live alongside tests and cover typical structures and edge cases
    - CI executes schema tests as part of the core package pipeline
implementation_notes:
  result: >-
    Added granular registry schema test suites and compose-level integration checks backed by shared fixtures to lock core
    behavior and defaults.
  challenges:
    - challenge: Initiative vision field appeared to trim during tests
      solution: Updated assertions to respect the schema's literal string behavior while still asserting scope trimming.
  insights:
    - Registry field schemas (metadata, shared, issue, milestone, initiative) now have direct unit coverage.
    - Compose tests confirm defaults like priority, estimation, and schema_version flow through artifact schemas.
