  summary: >-
    Implement relationships (blocks, blocked_by) and artifact metadata (title,
    priority, estimation, created_by, assignee, schema_version, events) schemas with
    no fan-out persistence fields.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Relationships default to empty arrays; only sibling IDs allowed by validator
    - Artifact metadata requires all core fields and at least one event (draft)
    - Unit tests cover valid and invalid structures
