  summary: >-
    Implement relationships (blocks, blocked_by) and artifact metadata (title,
    priority, estimation, created_by, assignee, schema_version, events) schemas with
    no fan-out persistence fields.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Relationships default to empty arrays; only sibling IDs allowed by validator
    - Artifact metadata requires all core fields and at least one event (draft)
    - Unit tests cover valid and invalid structures

implementation_notes:
  result: "Added RelationshipsSchema, ArtifactIdSchema (multi-letter initiatives), ArtifactMetadataSchema; sibling-type validator"
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Schema alone cannot know current artifact ID to enforce sibling rule"
      solution: "Expose validateSiblingIds(contextId) helper for caller-side checks"
    - challenge: "Differentiate initiative prefixes (A vs AA)"
      solution: "Parse base-26 style prefix with /^[A-Z]+/ and compare exactly"
  insights:
    - "Siblings must share the same initiative and artifact type (milestone↔milestone, issue↔issue)"
    - "Validate priority and estimation against constants (PRIORITIES, ESTIMATION_SIZES) for actionable errors"
  tags: [core, validation, relationships, metadata, schemas, ids, multi-letter-initiatives, sibling-type, helper-validateSiblingIds]
