  summary: >-
    Define canonical constants for artifact states, priorities, estimation sizes,
    event triggers (including children_started, children_completed, parent_completed,
    parent_archived, manual_cancel), and
    artifact type enumerations for v1.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Constants export includes states, priorities, estimation sizes, artifact types
    - Triggers include dependencies_met, has_dependencies, branch_created, pr_ready, pr_merged, dependency_completed, children_started, children_completed, parent_completed, parent_archived, manual_cancel
    - Types inferred from constants are available for downstream schemas
implementation_notes:
  result: "Add v1 constants/types: states, priorities, estimation sizes, artifact types"
  insights:
    - "Expose arrays alongside enums for validation (ARTIFACT_EVENTS, EVENT_TRIGGERS)"
    - "Added missing children_started, children_completed to triggers list"
  tags: [core, constants, triggers, validation, priorities, estimation, artifact-types]
