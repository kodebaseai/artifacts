  summary: >-
    Provide a validator that auto-detects artifact type from structure,
    exposes validateInitiative/validateMilestone/validateIssue, and surfaces
    user-friendly validation errors.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - getArtifactType detects types by content reliably
    - validateX methods enforce schemas and throw formatted errors
    - Works standalone and when composed with the parser
