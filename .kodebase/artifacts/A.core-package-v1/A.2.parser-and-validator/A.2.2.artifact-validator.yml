content:
  summary: >-
    Provide a validator that auto-detects artifact type from structure,
    exposes validateInitiative/validateMilestone/validateIssue, and surfaces
    user-friendly validation errors.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - getArtifactType detects types by content reliably
    - validateX methods enforce schemas and throw formatted errors
    - Works standalone and when composed with the parser
implementation_notes:
  result: >-
    Added `packages/core/src/validator/artifact-validator.ts` exposing type detection,
    per-artifact validate helpers, and an `ArtifactValidationError`, all exported through
    `@kodebase/core` with docs touches in README.
  challenges:
    - challenge: Type detection needed a deterministic fallback when multiple schemas failed similarly.
      solution: Sort schema results by issue count and bail out when the top two ties to avoid random picks.
    - challenge: Mocking schema failures for detection ties broke type expectations in tests.
      solution: Cast mocked Zod results to the precise safeParse return type and restore spies cleanly.
    - challenge: Parser interop tests surfaced YAML failure branches that weren’t covered.
      solution: Exercised strings that parse to non-objects and leveraged parser errors to highlight friendly messaging.
  insights:
    - Validator and parser now share the same error surface, making downstream error handling consistent.
    - Coverage-driven development on validator branches keeps edge cases (like ambiguous types) locked down for future changes.
