  summary: >-
    Implement YAML → typed parsing and artifact validation with actionable
    errors, including type detection and Zod error formatting.
  deliverables:
    - ArtifactParser with parseYaml and parseInitiative/Milestone/Issue
    - ArtifactValidator with auto type detection and validateX methods
    - Error formatter producing readable, actionable messages
  validation:
    - Invalid YAML produces clear messages; valid docs parse into correct types
    - Type detection resolves initiative/milestone/issue reliably
    - Unit tests covering success and failure cases
