  summary: >-
    Implement YAML → typed parsing and artifact validation with actionable
    errors, including type detection and Zod error formatting.
  deliverables:
    - ArtifactParser with parseYaml and parseInitiative/Milestone/Issue
    - ArtifactValidator with auto type detection and validateX methods
    - Error formatter producing readable, actionable messages
  validation:
    - Invalid YAML produces clear messages; valid docs parse into correct types
    - Type detection resolves initiative/milestone/issue reliably
    - Unit tests covering success and failure cases
delivery_summary:
  outcome: Parser and validator stack shipped with actionable errors, fixtures, and docs ready for downstream tooling.
  delivered:
    - ArtifactParser exposing YAML helpers with comprehensive unit coverage.
    - ArtifactValidator with type detection, validateX helpers, and shared error surface.
    - Error formatter translating Zod issues into path/reason/suggestion tuples adopted by validator and parser.
    - Fixture-backed tests plus module READMEs guiding contributors through parser/validator and golden workflow.
  next: Partner with A.3 to wire readiness/relationship constraints on top of the parser/validator foundation and integrate fixtures into CLI smoke tests.
  risks:
    - Downstream consumers must align on the new error formats; legacy tooling may require adapter shims.
    - Fixture goldens can drift without review when schemas evolve—schedule periodic audits alongside schema updates.
