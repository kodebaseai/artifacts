  summary: >-
    Build a robust parser that reads YAML content and validates it against the
    artifact schemas, returning typed Initiative/Milestone/Issue objects with
    formatted validation errors.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - parseYaml rejects empty/invalid YAML with clear messages
    - parseInitiative/Milestone/Issue validate against schemas and return typed objects
    - Zod errors are converted into readable messages (no raw Zod trees)
