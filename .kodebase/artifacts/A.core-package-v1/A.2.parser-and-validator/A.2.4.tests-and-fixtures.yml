  summary: >-
    Provide unit tests for parser and validator (success and failure cases) and
    golden fixtures for typical artifacts and error scenarios.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Tests for valid initiative/milestone/issue fixtures pass with types inferred
    - Invalid fixtures produce expected error messages and paths
    - All tests wired into the repo test pipeline
