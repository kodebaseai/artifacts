content:
  summary: >-
    Provide unit tests for parser and validator (success and failure cases) and
    golden fixtures for typical artifacts and error scenarios.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Tests for valid initiative/milestone/issue fixtures pass with types inferred
    - Invalid fixtures produce expected error messages and paths
    - All tests wired into the repo test pipeline
implementation_notes:
  result: >-
    Added shared fixture helpers plus parser/validator fixture tests that load
    YAML goldens and assert parsed data and error payloads match stored JSON
    expectations. Documented parser, validator, and fixture directories with
    READMEs.
  challenges:
    - challenge: Needed a single loader for YAML/JSON fixtures usable from both parser and validator suites.
      solution: Introduced `src/test-utils/load-fixture.ts` to centralise fixture access.
    - challenge: Ensuring fixture tests assert exact object equality without duplicating large inline structures.
      solution: Store parsed expectations as JSON snapshots and compare them directly in the fixture tests.
  insights:
    - Fixture-driven tests make it easy to spot regressions when parser or validator output changes, enabling quick review of golden diffs.
    - README docs now point contributors toward the fixture workflow, reducing onboarding friction.
