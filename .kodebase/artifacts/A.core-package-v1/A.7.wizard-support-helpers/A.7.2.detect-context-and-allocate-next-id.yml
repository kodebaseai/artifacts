  summary: >-
    Implement context detection for a working directory or target path and allocation
    of the next id under a parent (e.g., next milestone A.N or next issue A.N.M).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Context detection returns one of: initiative, milestone, issue"
    - Allocation scans siblings and returns the next numeric segment in order
    - Works for multi-digit numeric segments and sparse ranges
