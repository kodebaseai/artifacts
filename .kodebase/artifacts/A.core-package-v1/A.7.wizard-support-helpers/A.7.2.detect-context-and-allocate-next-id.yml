  summary: >-
    Implement context detection for a working directory or target path and allocation
    of the next id under a parent (e.g., next milestone A.N or next issue A.N.M).
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Context detection returns one of: initiative, milestone, issue"
    - Allocation scans siblings and returns the next numeric segment in order
    - Works for multi-digit numeric segments and sparse ranges
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added `detectContextLevel` (pure parent-ID-based logic) and `allocateNextId` (loader-based sibling scanning); 22 tests passing with 95% coverage, supporting sparse ranges and multi-letter/multi-digit IDs."
  tags: [core, wizard, id-allocation, context-detection]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Initial design used filesystem walking for context detection, which was complex and didn't align with wizard workflow"
      solution: "Simplified to pure parent-ID-based logic: no parent → initiative, 1-segment parent → milestone, 2-segment parent → issue. Much simpler and perfectly suited for the `kodebase add` wizard."
    - challenge: "Allocating next ID requires finding all siblings without knowing their slugs"
      solution: "Reused `loadAllArtifactPaths` from loader stack and filtered by parent ID prefix, extracting numeric segments to find max+1 (never fill gaps)."
    - challenge: "Supporting multi-letter initiatives and multi-digit segments in allocation"
      solution: "Parent ID validation uses same regex pattern as other wizard helpers (`[A-Z]+(?:\\.\\d+)*`), and numeric segment parsing uses parseInt for any length."
  insights:
    - "Context detection doesn't need filesystem access - parent ID alone determines what children can be created, which is exactly what the wizard needs."
    - "Sparse range handling is intentional: always use max+1 strategy (e.g., if A.1, A.3, A.5 exist, next is A.6), ensuring IDs are append-only and never reused."
    - "The functions compose naturally with `resolveArtifactPaths` from A.7.1: allocateNextId gives you the ID, then resolveArtifactPaths tells you where to write it."
