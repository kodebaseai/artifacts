  summary: >-
    Provide a read-only helper to check the parent chain at runtime and determine
    if any ancestor is currently blocked or cancelled, with a reason string.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Returns a boolean and reason string for gating decisions
    - Looks up parents via id prefix and current event state
    - No writes to artifacts; safe for CLI `--check-parent`
