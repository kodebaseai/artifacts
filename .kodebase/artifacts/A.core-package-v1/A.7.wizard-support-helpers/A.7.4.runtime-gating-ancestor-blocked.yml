  summary: >-
    Provide a read-only helper to check the parent chain at runtime and determine
    if any ancestor is currently blocked or cancelled, with a reason string.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Returns a boolean and reason string for gating decisions
    - Looks up parents via id prefix and current event state
    - No writes to artifacts; safe for CLI `--check-parent`
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added `isAncestorBlockedOrCancelled` function with parent chain traversal and state checking; 14 comprehensive tests passing with 100% coverage, ready for CLI integration."
  tags: [core, wizard, gating, runtime-validation, parent-blocking]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Defensive behavior when parent artifacts missing"
      solution: "Return `isBlocked: false` to allow operations on orphaned artifacts rather than permanently blocking them. This prevents corner cases where manual intervention would be required."
  insights:
    - "The simplified sibling-only blocking model makes parent gating trivial: just walk up ID segments and check state. No relationship parsing needed."
