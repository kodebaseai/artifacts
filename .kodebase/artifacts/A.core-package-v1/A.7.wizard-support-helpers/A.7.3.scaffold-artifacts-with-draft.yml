  summary: >-
    Implement scaffold helpers that build in-memory artifacts with minimal content
    and an initial draft event using the correct trigger and timestamp.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Helpers return typed objects that pass schema validation
    - Draft event uses trigger `artifact_created` and ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
    - Notes and optional fields are supported without breaking validation
