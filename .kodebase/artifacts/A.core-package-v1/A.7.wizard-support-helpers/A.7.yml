  summary: >-
    Provide UI-agnostic helpers to bootstrap artifacts (layout, IDs, scaffolds)
    and to gate starts based on ancestor states.
  deliverables:
    - ensureArtifactsLayout and resolveArtifactPaths({ id, slug, baseDir })
    - detectContextLevel(targetPath|cwd) and allocateNextId(parentId, type, loader)
    - scaffoldInitiative/Milestone/Issue with initial draft event (artifact_created)
    - isAncestorBlockedOrCancelled(artifactId, loader)
  validation:
    - CLI can scaffold A/A.1/A.1.1 with these helpers
    - Gating prevents start when ancestors are blocked/cancelled; tests cover cases
