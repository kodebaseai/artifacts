  summary: >-
    Provide UI-agnostic helpers to bootstrap artifacts (layout, IDs, scaffolds)
    and to gate starts based on ancestor states.
  deliverables:
    - ensureArtifactsLayout and resolveArtifactPaths({ id, slug, baseDir })
    - detectContextLevel(targetPath|cwd) and allocateNextId(parentId, type, loader)
    - scaffoldInitiative/Milestone/Issue with initial draft event (artifact_created)
    - isAncestorBlockedOrCancelled(artifactId, loader)
  validation:
    - CLI can scaffold A/A.1/A.1.1 with these helpers
    - Gating prevents start when ancestors are blocked/cancelled; tests cover cases
delivery_summary:
  outcome: >-
    Complete wizard helper API with layout management, context detection, ID allocation,
    artifact scaffolding, and runtime gating; comprehensive test coverage (97%) and
    integration tests validating end-to-end workflows ready for CLI wizard integration.
  delivered:
    - "Layout and path resolution (`artifact-layout.ts`) with `ensureArtifactsLayout` creating `.kodebase/artifacts` structure and `resolveArtifactPaths` handling canonical paths with slug support; 100% test coverage."
    - "Context detection and ID allocation (`artifact-context.ts`) with `detectContextLevel` determining artifact type from parent and `allocateNextId` scanning siblings for sparse-aware numeric allocation; 100% test coverage."
    - "Artifact scaffolding helpers (`artifact-scaffolder.ts`) with `scaffoldInitiative`, `scaffoldMilestone`, and `scaffoldIssue` creating validated in-memory artifacts with initial draft events; 100% test coverage."
    - "Runtime gating helper (`artifact-gating.ts`) with `isAncestorBlockedOrCancelled` walking parent chain to prevent operations when ancestors are blocked/cancelled; defensive handling for orphaned artifacts; 100% test coverage."
    - "Integration test suite (`wizard-helpers.integration.test.ts`) with 11 comprehensive tests validating end-to-end workflows (layout → allocate → scaffold → write), file service integration, gating scenarios, and edge cases; 97% overall coverage with 333 passing tests."
    - "Documentation updates to wizard module README describing all four helper modules and their integration with loader stack."
  next: >-
    Integrate wizard helpers into `kodebase add` CLI command for interactive artifact creation,
    implement `--check-parent` flag for runtime gating enforcement, and extend helpers to support
    batch artifact creation workflows for initiative planning.
  risks:
    - "Letter increment algorithm for root initiatives (A→B→Z→AA) assumes sequential allocation; concurrent artifact creation may require locking or atomic ID reservation."
    - "Integration tests use `allocateNextInitiativeId` helper not exposed in public API; CLI may need this promoted if manual initiative ID selection isn't desired."
