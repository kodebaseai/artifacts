  summary: >-
    Implement helpers to ensure the `.kodebase/artifacts` layout exists and to resolve
    canonical dir/file paths from an artifact id and optional slug.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Layout helper creates `.kodebase/artifacts` if missing and is idempotent
    - Path resolver returns dirPath and filePath for initiative, milestone, and issue ids
    - Slug support included in file names without altering the id
