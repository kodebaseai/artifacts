  summary: >-
    Determine when a parent should progress based on child states: move parent to
    in_progress when the first active child starts; move to in_review when all
    active children complete. Exclude cancelled children from counts.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: true, newState: in_progress } when any active child is in_progress/in_review/completed and parent is ready"
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: true, newState: in_review } when all active children are completed"
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: false, reason } otherwise; cancelled children do not affect counts"
    - "Deterministic outputs for identical child state inputs"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Implemented `CascadeEngine.shouldCascadeToParent` inside @kodebase/core with deterministic recommendations and exported it for consumers."
  tags: [core, cascade, automation]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Deriving the current child state safely from raw event logs"
      solution: "Introduced an `isArtifactEvent` type guard so the helper only returns canonical states validated against `ARTIFACT_EVENTS`."
    - challenge: "Avoiding false positives from cancelled or archived children"
      solution: "Explicitly filtered those terminal states before evaluating progress/completion logic."
    - challenge: "Surfacing actionable reasons alongside cascade decisions"
      solution: "Returned structured results with descriptive reason strings (e.g., remaining active children count) to aid reporting."
  insights:
    - "Treating cascades as pure, deterministic functions keeps automation predictable and testable."
    - "Reason strings make it easier for higher-level tooling to explain why a cascade did or did not trigger."
