  summary: >-
    Determine when a parent should progress based on child states: move parent to
    in_progress when the first active child starts; move to in_review when all
    active children complete. Exclude cancelled children from counts.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: true, newState: in_progress } when any active child is in_progress/in_review/completed and parent is ready"
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: true, newState: in_review } when all active children are completed"
    - "Returns { shouldCascade: false, reason } otherwise; cancelled children do not affect counts"
    - "Deterministic outputs for identical child state inputs"
