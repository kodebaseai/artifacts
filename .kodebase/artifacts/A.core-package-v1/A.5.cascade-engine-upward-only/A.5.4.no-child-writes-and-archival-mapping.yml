  summary: >-
    Align cascade implementation with rule "no persistent downward propagation" — the
    engine must never write child events. Define when to use parent_completed and
    parent_archived triggers in cascade events and how archived is reached via completion/cancel flows.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - No code path writes events to child artifacts during cascades
    - Clear mapping of triggers used for parent transitions and for archival recommendations
    - Tests assert absence of child writes and correct trigger usage
