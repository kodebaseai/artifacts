  summary: >-
    Align cascade implementation with rule "no persistent downward propagation" — the
    engine must never write child events. Define when to use parent_completed and
    parent_archived triggers in cascade events and how archived is reached via completion/cancel flows.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - No code path writes events to child artifacts during cascades
    - Clear mapping of triggers used for parent transitions and for archival recommendations
    - Tests assert absence of child writes and correct trigger usage
implementation_notes:
  result: "Cascade engine now separates parent archival triggers (completion vs. cancellation) without mutating child artifacts, backed by targeted unit tests."
  tags: [core, cascade, triggers]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Differentiating archival triggers while reusing the event builder"
      solution: "Added `resolveCascadeTrigger` with a dedicated map for archival cascade types, keeping the canonical builder path intact."
    - challenge: "Ensuring child histories remain untouched during cascade evaluation"
      solution: "Introduced an immutability test that snapshots child events before running the cascade logic."
  insights:
    - "Treating archival cascades as metadata-only recommendations preserves the no-downward-write invariant."
    - "Explicit cascade_type values document the parent flow, simplifying future CLI integrations."
