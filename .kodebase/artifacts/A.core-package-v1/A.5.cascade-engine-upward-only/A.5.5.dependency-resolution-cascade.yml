  summary: >-
    Add automation for the dependency resolution flow: when a blocking sibling
    completes, mark the dependent's blocking_dependencies entry as resolved with
    a timestamp and emit a ready event once all blockers clear.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Blocking dependency completion flips corresponding metadata entries to { resolved: true, resolved_at: <timestamp> }"
    - "When all blocking dependencies resolve, a new ready event is added for the dependent artifact"
    - "No duplicate or out-of-order events are produced; existing metadata remains untouched beyond the resolved flags"
    - "Unit tests cover single and multiple dependency scenarios, including already-resolved entries"
