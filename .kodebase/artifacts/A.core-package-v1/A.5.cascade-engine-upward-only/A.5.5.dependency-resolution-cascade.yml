  summary: >-
    Add automation for the dependency resolution flow: when a blocking sibling
    completes, mark the dependent's blocking_dependencies entry as resolved with
    a timestamp and emit a ready event once all blockers clear.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Blocking dependency completion flips corresponding metadata entries to { resolved: true, resolved_at: <timestamp> }"
    - "When all blocking dependencies resolve, a new ready event is added for the dependent artifact"
    - "No duplicate or out-of-order events are produced; existing metadata remains untouched beyond the resolved flags"
    - "Unit tests cover single and multiple dependency scenarios, including already-resolved entries"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Cascade engine exposes `resolveDependencyCompletion`, updating blocking metadata and emitting ready events when all blockers clear without mutating the input artifact."
  tags: [core, cascade, dependencies]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Avoiding mutation while updating dependency metadata"
      solution: "Work on a cloned artifact snapshot so callers retain their original state."
    - challenge: "Choosing the right trigger when promoting dependents"
      solution: "Reuse the event builder with the existing `dependency_completed` trigger to keep audit consistency."
  insights:
    - "Dependency resolution sits alongside cascade recommendations, but remains a pure data update without writing to siblings."
    - "Tracking fully resolved dependency IDs in event metadata gives downstream automation clear context."
