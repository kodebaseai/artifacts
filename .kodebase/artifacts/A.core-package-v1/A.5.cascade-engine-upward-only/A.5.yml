  summary: >-
    Provide upward-only cascade recommendations: parent progresses when first
    child starts; parent enters review when all children complete.
  deliverables:
    - shouldCascadeToParent(children, parentState?) for in_progress and in_review
    - generateCascadeEvent(newState, triggerEvent, cascadeType) for reporting
    - Tests for issue→milestone and milestone→initiative scenarios
  validation:
    - Deterministic outputs for given child states and parent state
    - Coverage for edge cases (cancelled children excluded from counts)
