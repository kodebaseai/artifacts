  summary: >-
    Provide upward-only cascade recommendations: parent progresses when first
    child starts; parent enters review when all children complete.
  deliverables:
    - shouldCascadeToParent(children, parentState?) for in_progress and in_review
    - generateCascadeEvent(newState, triggerEvent, cascadeType) for reporting
    - Tests for issue竊知ilestone and milestone竊段nitiative scenarios
  validation:
    - Deterministic outputs for given child states and parent state
    - Coverage for edge cases (cancelled children excluded from counts)
delivery_summary:
  outcome: >-
    Upward-only cascade logic now covers parent progression, cascade event
    generation, dependency resolution, and cancellation guardrails without
    mutating child artifacts.
  delivered:
    - "`CascadeEngine.shouldCascadeToParent` handling issue竊知ilestone竊段nitiative cascades with deterministic reasoning and regression tests."
    - "`CascadeEngine.generateCascadeEvent` with explicit trigger mapping (progress, completion, archival) and rich metadata for traceable cascades."
    - "`resolveDependencyCompletion` helper updating `blocking_dependencies` metadata and emitting dependency-completed ready events when appropriate."
    - "`evaluateParentCancellation` guard preventing parents from cancelling once work has shipped, plus coverage for allowed scenarios."
    - "Documentation refresh for cascade/state/schemas modules and a changeset for `@kodebase/core`."
  next: >-
    Surface these helpers in the CLI so dependency resolution, cascade
    recommendations, and cancellation guardrails execute during real workflows.
