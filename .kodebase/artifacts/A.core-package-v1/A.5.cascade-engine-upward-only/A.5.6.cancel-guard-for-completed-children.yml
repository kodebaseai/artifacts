content:
  summary: >-
    Block parent cancellation whenever any child artifact is already completed,
    returning a clear explanation and alternative remediation guidance instead of
    emitting a cascading cancelled event.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Cancellation flow inspects child states and rejects parent cancel when any child is completed"
    - "Returned error includes child IDs and guidance to archive or manually adjust remaining work"
    - "Automation leaves parent state unchanged on rejection"
    - "Unit tests cover single and multi-child scenarios, including allowed cancel when no completed children exist"
