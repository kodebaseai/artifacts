  summary: >-
    Block parent cancellation whenever any child artifact is already completed,
    returning a clear explanation and alternative remediation guidance instead of
    emitting a cascading cancelled event.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Cancellation flow inspects child states and rejects parent cancel when any child is completed"
    - "Returned error includes child IDs and guidance to archive or manually adjust remaining work"
    - "Automation leaves parent state unchanged on rejection"
    - "Unit tests cover single and multi-child scenarios, including allowed cancel when no completed children exist"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added `evaluateParentCancellation` to the cascade engine, blocking parent cancellation when completed children exist with actionable guidance."
  tags: [core, cascade, cancellation]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Surfacing meaningful context without mutating child artifacts"
      solution: "Accept optional child IDs and build read-only decisions that list offending children while leaving inputs untouched."
    - challenge: "Keeping behaviour deterministic for automation consumers"
      solution: "Centralised child state checks through existing helpers to guarantee consistent results."
  insights:
    - "Refusing cancellation once work has shipped nudges operators toward archival flows instead of destructive rollbacks."
    - "Guardrails live alongside cascade evaluations, ensuring upstream automation can reuse shared helpers."
