  summary: >-
    Add end-to-end tests covering the primary flows: create→validate, start→cascade,
    and complete→cascade using the sample fixtures and core helpers.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Validation: new artifacts with draft only → post-merge ready/blocked computation passes'
    - 'Cascade: last issue completed → milestone/initiative get in_review recommendations'
    - 'Completion: completion info present → completed event appended (simulated)'
    - 'Tests run under Vitest; no network, deterministic results'
