  summary: >-
    Provide golden fixtures and integration tests across core flows; ensure CI
    runs and reports status for the core package.
  deliverables:
    - Sample artifacts tree (A, A.1, A.1.1…A.1.n with dependencies)
    - Integration tests for create→validate, start→cascade, complete→cascade
    - CI tasks wired to turbo pipeline for tests
  validation:
    - script `pnpm test` at repo root runs and passes core suites
    - Coverage on core modules is healthy and stable
delivery_summary:
  outcome: >-
    Testing infrastructure fully established for core package with comprehensive fixtures,
    integration tests, CI pipeline integration, and coverage thresholds - all 349 tests
    passing with 97% coverage.
  delivered:
    - "A.9.1: Sample artifacts tree fixtures (A, A.1, A.1.1…A.1.n) with dependency relationships"
    - "A.9.2: 16 integration tests covering create→validate, start→cascade, complete→cascade flows"
    - "A.9.3: CI pipeline wired with turbo test task, GitHub Actions job, and remote caching enabled"
    - "A.9.4: Coverage thresholds set (95/100/85/95) with lcov reporting for CI integration"
  next: >-
    Testing foundation ready for CLI package development and validation computation implementation
    in git-ops layer.
