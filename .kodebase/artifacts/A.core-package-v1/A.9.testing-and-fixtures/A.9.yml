  summary: >-
    Provide golden fixtures and integration tests across core flows; ensure CI
    runs and reports status for the core package.
  deliverables:
    - Sample artifacts tree (A, A.1, A.1.1…A.1.n with dependencies)
    - Integration tests for create→validate, start→cascade, complete→cascade
    - CI tasks wired to turbo pipeline for tests
  validation:
    - script `pnpm test` at repo root runs and passes core suites
    - Coverage on core modules is healthy and stable
