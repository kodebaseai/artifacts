  summary: >-
    Define coverage thresholds for critical modules and ensure tests are deterministic
    without flakiness; configure reporters for local and CI.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - 'Coverage thresholds set for schemas, validator, cascade, loader'
    - 'Tests run deterministically locally and in CI'
    - 'Reporting configured (text/summary and lcov)'
