  summary: >-
    Implement slug-tolerant ID extraction and recursive discovery; provide
    stable read/write of YAML artifacts.
  deliverables:
    - ID extraction regex ^([A-Z](?:\.\d+)*) (handle slugs via optional suffix)
    - loadAllArtifactPaths, loadArtifactsByType, getArtifactIdFromPath
    - ArtifactFileService read/write with stable formatting
  validation:
    - Correct extraction for A.yml, A.1.yml, and A.1.1.<slug>.yml
    - Discovery handles thousands via recursion; unit tests cover typical trees
delivery_summary:
  outcome: >-
    Loader stack with slug-tolerant ID extraction, recursive discovery, stable file I/O,
    and integration test coverage shipped and ready for CLI integration.
  delivered:
    - "Slug-tolerant ID extraction (`artifact-paths.ts`) with regex handling A.yml, A.1.yml, A.1.1.slug.yml patterns and comprehensive unit tests for valid/invalid filenames."
    - "Recursive artifact discovery (`artifact-loader.ts`) with type filters distinguishing initiatives/milestones/issues by ID segment count, plus hidden file/folder exclusion."
    - "Stable YAML file service (`artifact-file-service.ts`) with `readArtifact`/`writeArtifact` helpers using formatting options (`lineWidth: 0`) that prevent spurious diffs on automation commits."
    - "Integration test suite with golden fixture tree exercising discovery, type filtering, round-trip read/write stability, and malformed YAML error handling; 100% coverage on loading module."
    - "Documentation updates to core package README and loading module README, plus changeset for `@kodebase/core` minor release."
  next: >-
    Wire loader utilities into CLI commands for artifact discovery workflows,
    integrate with validator/parser for end-to-end artifact processing, and expose
    cascade automation hooks that leverage the loader stack.
  risks:
    - "Performance on very large artifact trees (1000+ files) hasn't been benchmarked; may need pagination or caching strategies for enterprise-scale monorepos."
