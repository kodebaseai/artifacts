  summary: >-
    Implement slug-tolerant ID extraction and recursive discovery; provide
    stable read/write of YAML artifacts.
  deliverables:
    - ID extraction regex ^([A-Z](?:\.\d+)*) (handle slugs via optional suffix)
    - loadAllArtifactPaths, loadArtifactsByType, getArtifactIdFromPath
    - ArtifactFileService read/write with stable formatting
  validation:
    - Correct extraction for A.yml, A.1.yml, and A.1.1.<slug>.yml
    - Discovery handles thousands via recursion; unit tests cover typical trees
