  summary: >-
    Implement YAML read/write operations with stable serialization options to minimize
    diff noise and preserve readability across automation commits.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "readArtifact reads UTF-8 files and parses YAML safely; informative errors include the path"
    - "writeArtifact serializes with stable ordering and plain scalars where possible (e.g., lineWidth=0)"
    - "Round-trip read→write does not introduce spurious formatting changes"
    - "Error handling wraps fs errors with path context"
