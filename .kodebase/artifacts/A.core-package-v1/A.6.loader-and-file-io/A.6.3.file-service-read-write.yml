  summary: >-
    Implement YAML read/write operations with stable serialization options to minimize
    diff noise and preserve readability across automation commits.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "readArtifact reads UTF-8 files and parses YAML safely; informative errors include the path"
    - "writeArtifact serializes with stable ordering and plain scalars where possible (e.g., lineWidth=0)"
    - "Round-trip read→write does not introduce spurious formatting changes"
    - "Error handling wraps fs errors with path context"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added `readArtifact`/`writeArtifact` helpers that wrap fs errors and use stable YAML serialization; tests mock read/write scenarios."
  tags: [core, loader, file-service]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Preserving predictable formatting across automation writes"
      solution: "Configured YAML stringify with `lineWidth: 0` to avoid auto wrapping."
    - challenge: "Providing actionable errors without leaking internals"
      solution: "Catch fs exceptions and rethrow with the artifact path included in the message."
  insights:
    - "Pure read/write helpers make it easy to plug into CLI pipelines without repeating fs boilerplate."
