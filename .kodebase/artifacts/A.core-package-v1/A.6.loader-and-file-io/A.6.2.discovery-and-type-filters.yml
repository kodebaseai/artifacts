  summary: >-
    Implement recursive discovery of artifact files under `.kodebase/artifacts/`,
    expose type filters (initiative, milestone, issue), and ensure performance scales
    with number of siblings.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "loadAllArtifactPaths returns absolute paths to all *.yml artifacts under the artifacts root"
    - "loadArtifactsByType returns only IDs of the requested type using ID length heuristics (1, 2, 3+ segments)"
    - "Discovery ignores non-artifact files and hidden files"
    - "Performance is O(siblings) per check; large trees discovered via recursion"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Added recursive artifact discovery and type filters with tests covering hidden files, slugged names, and ID segment heuristics."
  tags: [core, loader, discovery]
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Efficient recursion without pulling in a tree-walking dependency"
      solution: "Implemented a lightweight async walker using Node's `fs.promises.readdir` with `Dirent` metadata."
    - challenge: "Filtering by artifact type without parsing YAML first"
      solution: "Reused slug-tolerant ID extraction and counted segments (1/2/3) to classify initiatives, milestones, and issues."
  insights:
    - "A pure path-based pass keeps discovery fast and lets higher layers decide when to parse artifacts."
    - "Ignoring hidden entries and non-matching files up front mirrors methodology expectations for the artifacts tree."
