  summary: >-
    Implement recursive discovery of artifact files under `.kodebase/artifacts/`,
    expose type filters (initiative, milestone, issue), and ensure performance scales
    with number of siblings.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "loadAllArtifactPaths returns absolute paths to all *.yml artifacts under the artifacts root"
    - "loadArtifactsByType returns only IDs of the requested type using ID length heuristics (1, 2, 3+ segments)"
    - "Discovery ignores non-artifact files and hidden files"
    - "Performance is O(siblings) per check; large trees discovered via recursion"
