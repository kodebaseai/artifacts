  summary: >-
    Add unit and integration tests with golden fixtures for discovery, type filters,
    ID extraction, and file read/write stability.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Fixtures cover A.yml, A.1.yml, A.1.1.slug.yml and mixed trees"
    - "Type filters return expected sets on fixtures"
    - "Round-trip read/write assertions pass; no spurious diffs"
    - "Edge cases: hidden folders/files ignored; malformed YAML yields clear errors"
