# Schema for Initiative artifacts in Kodebase
#
# v2.0 Changes:
# - Made completion_summary optional (many initiatives are ongoing)
# - Simplified success criteria structure
# - Added practical examples
# - Focused on strategic value over process

# Philosophy for v2:
# - Initiatives are about vision and strategy, not tactics
# - Success criteria should be ambitious but measurable  
# - Scope clarity prevents scope creep
# - Most initiatives won't have completion summaries (that's OK)
# - Keep the focus on outcomes that matter to users/business
