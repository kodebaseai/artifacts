    ## What does this milestone achieve? Why does it matter?
    ## Example: Implement complete user authentication system including 
    ## registration, login, password reset, and session management to 
    ## enable secure access to the application.
    
  deliverables:
    - ## Concrete output 1 (what will exist when done?)
    - ## Concrete output 2 (what can people use?)
    - ## Concrete output 3 (what's the tangible result?)
    # Examples:
    # - "Working login/registration forms"
    # - "Password reset email flow"
    # - "Session management with JWT tokens"
    # - "API documentation for auth endpoints"
    # - "Integration test suite"
    
  # Optional but recommended: How do we verify success?
  validation:
    - "All auth endpoints have >90% test coverage"
    - "Security audit passes with no critical issues"
    - "5 users successfully complete registration flow"

# Optional: Any important context or constraints
notes: |
  ## Example: Must integrate with existing LDAP system
  ## Example: Performance target: <200ms response time

# === Optional Section (delete if not needed) ===

# Fill after milestone completion if you have strategic insights:
# completion_summary:
#   key_achievements:
#     - "Reduced authentication time by 50%"
#     - "Zero security vulnerabilities in pen test"
#   strategic_decisions:
#     - "Chose JWT over sessions for stateless auth"
#     - "Implemented rate limiting at API gateway level"
#   knowledge_generated:
#     - "JWT rotation strategy prevents token theft"
#     - "Bcrypt with 12 rounds optimal for our use case"
#   team_impact: "Team now proficient with OAuth2 flows"
#   next_milestone_insights: "Start with the user profile schema design based on auth token structure"
