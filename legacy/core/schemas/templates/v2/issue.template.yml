  summary: >
    ## What needs to be done and why? Include any important context.
    ## Example: Update the login form validation to prevent SQL injection 
    ## attacks by sanitizing user input and using parameterized queries.
    
  acceptance_criteria:
    - ## Specific, testable criterion (how do we know it's done?)
    - ## Another criterion (what must work?)
    - ## Final criterion (what's the definition of success?)
    # Examples:
    # - "User input is sanitized before database queries"
    # - "Parameterized queries used for all user data"  
    # - "Security scan shows no SQL injection vulnerabilities"

# Optional: Implementation hints or important context
notes: |
  ## Any gotchas, dependencies, or helpful context
  ## Example: The current form uses raw SQL - need to migrate to ORM

#       solution: "Solved by doing ABC"

# Fill after completion if you learned something valuable:
# completion_analysis:
#   key_insights:
#     - "Pattern X works great for this type of problem"
#     - "Watch out for edge case Y"
#   implementation_approach: "Used factory pattern to handle different validator types"
#   manual_testing_steps:
