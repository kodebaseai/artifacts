  vision: >
    ## The inspiring future state this creates (dream big!)
    ## Example: Create a world where developers focus purely on intent 
    ## while AI handles all implementation details, reducing time from 
    ## idea to production by 100x and making software development 
    ## accessible to billions of new creators.
    
  scope: >
    ## Clear boundaries - what's IN and OUT
    ## IN: What this initiative WILL deliver
    ## OUT: What it explicitly WON'T do (helps prevent scope creep)
    ## Example:
    ## IN: Natural language to code, AI pair programming, automated testing
    ## OUT: Cloud deployment, team collaboration features, enterprise SSO
    
  success_criteria:
    - ## Measurable outcome 1 (how do we know we succeeded?)
    - ## Measurable outcome 2 (what impact will we see?)
    - ## Measurable outcome 3 (what changes in the world?)
    # Examples:
    # - "Developers report 10x productivity improvement"
    # - "80% of routine coding tasks handled by AI"
    # - "1000 active users building production apps"
    # - "Time from idea to MVP reduced from weeks to hours"

# Optional: Strategic context, assumptions, or risks
notes: |
  ## Example: Assumes continued exponential improvement in LLM capabilities
  ## Example: Primary risk is developer adoption resistance
