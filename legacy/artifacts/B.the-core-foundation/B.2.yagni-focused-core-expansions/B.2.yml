  summary: >
    Build practical utilities that directly address CLI needs and major friction
    points identified in A.3 analysis. Includes artifact query system for
    filtering, bidirectional relationship management, state transition helpers,
    and artifact factory with smart defaults. Each feature has an immediate use
    case in the CLI.
  deliverables:
    - Artifact query system for filtering and searching
    - Bidirectional relationship management utilities
    - State transition validation and helpers
    - Artifact factory with auto-population
    - Schema migration tools (v0.1.0 to v0.2.0)
  validation:
    - Queries support common CLI operations (list, filter, search)
    - Relationship updates maintain bidirectional consistency
    - State transitions enforce methodology rules
    - Factory reduces artifact creation boilerplate by 80%
    - Migration tools handle all existing artifacts

    - "Prioritized migration tooling to support future schema evolution"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "YAGNI principle proved crucial for development velocity"
    - "Migration tools demonstrate value of robust production-ready tooling"
    - "Event identity system in schema v0.2.0 enables cascade automation"
    - "Core package established as reliable foundation layer"
  team_impact:
    - "Delivered 5 core systems reducing manual overhead significantly"
    - "Estimated 140+ minutes per developer per week saved through automation"
    - "Created reusable utilities that support all future CLI commands"
    - "Foundation set for advanced automation capabilities"
  next_milestone_insights:
    - "B.3 can leverage event identity system for cascade automation"
    - "Migration tooling patterns can be reused for future schema evolution"
    - "Core foundation supports all planned automation features"
    - "Utilities directly enable CLI package (D milestone) development"

notes:
  friction_points_addressed: >
    This milestone directly addresses: - FP-007: Bidirectional relationship
    updates (5-10 min per relationship) - FP-009: Cascade dependency tracking
    (10-15 min per analysis) - FP-010: State validation before transition (1-2
    min per transition) - FP-001: Manual ID generation (2-3 min per creation)
  implementation_approach: >
    Follow YAGNI principle strictly. Each utility should solve a specific,
    immediate problem identified in the friction analysis. No premature
    abstractions or "nice to have" features.
