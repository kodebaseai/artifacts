  vision: >
    Build a read-only web interface that makes Kodebase accessible to
    non-developers and provides a beautiful visualization of project knowledge.
    This interface democratizes access to project context, allowing
    stakeholders, designers, and managers to understand development progress
    without command-line expertise. The web app serves as a window into the
    Git-based knowledge base.
  scope: >
    This initiative focuses on building the @kodebase/web app as a Next.js
    application with read-only capabilities. Includes: Artifact browsing, event
    timeline visualization, status dashboards, and search functionality.
    Excludes: Write operations, real-time updates, collaborative features,
    authentication, and multi-tenancy.
  success_criteria:
    - Beautiful, intuitive interface accessible to non-technical users
    - Sub-second page loads with proper caching
    - Mobile-responsive design that works on all devices
    - SEO-friendly with proper meta tags and sitemap
    - Deployable to Vercel with one click

notes:
  progressive_enhancement: >
    Start with static site generation (SSG) for maximum performance and SEO. Use
    React Server Components for efficient data fetching. Progressive enhancement
    ensures the site works without JavaScript while providing rich interactions
    when available. Future versions can add client-side features without
    breaking the foundation.

  data_access_strategy: >
    Direct file system access during build time for static generation. Use the
    @kodebase/core package for parsing artifacts and maintaining consistency
    with CLI and MCP. Cache processed data aggressively. Design data layer to
    easily switch to API-based access in future versions.

  design_philosophy: >
    Embrace simplicity and clarity. Use Tailwind CSS with
    @kodebase/tailwind-config for consistent design tokens. Focus on information
    hierarchy and readability. Every page should answer a clear question: What's
    the status? What's in progress? What's the history? Make complex data
    approachable through thoughtful visualization.

  milestone_details:
    F.1:
      title: Next.js foundation and routing
      summary: >
        Set up the Next.js 15 application with app router, TypeScript
        configuration, and basic layout. Implement the routing structure that
        mirrors the artifact hierarchy (/issues, /milestones, /initiatives).
        Configure static site generation with proper data fetching patterns.
      deliverables:
        - Next.js project with app router setup
        - Layout with navigation and @kodebase/ui components
        - Static routes for artifact types
        - 404 and error pages
        - Tailwind CSS with @kodebase/tailwind-config
      validation:
        - Routes load without errors
        - Navigation works correctly
        - Responsive on mobile devices
    F.2:

      summary: >
        Build the core pages for displaying artifacts with rich visualizations.
        This includes list views with filtering and sorting, detailed artifact
        pages with all metadata, and timeline views showing event history. Focus
        on making data beautiful and understandable.
      deliverables:
        - Issue list page with status filters
        - Milestone overview with progress visualization
        - Initiative dashboard with hierarchy tree
        - Individual artifact detail pages
        - Event timeline component
        - Status badge components
      validation:
        - All artifact types display correctly
        - Filters and sorting work
        - Timeline shows accurate history
    F.3:
      title: Search and discovery features
      summary: >
        Implement search functionality that helps users find artifacts quickly.
        This includes full-text search across artifacts, filter by
        status/assignee/dates, and smart suggestions. Build an intuitive search
        experience that non-developers can use effectively.
      deliverables:
        - Search bar with autocomplete
        - Advanced filter UI
        - Search results page
        - Recent searches feature
        - Quick filters for common queries

        - Search returns relevant results
        - Filters combine correctly
        - Performance remains fast
    F.4:
      title: Dashboard and analytics views
      summary: >
        Create dashboard views that provide at-a-glance project status and basic
        analytics. This includes overview dashboards, status distribution
        charts, and activity timelines. Use data visualization to make metrics
        accessible to all stakeholders.
      deliverables:
        - Project overview dashboard
        - Status distribution charts
        - Activity heatmap
        - Progress indicators
        - Assignee workload view
