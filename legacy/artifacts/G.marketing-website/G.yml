  vision: >
    Create a compelling marketing website that communicates Kodebase's value
    proposition to developers and engineering teams. The site should inspire
    adoption by clearly showing how Kodebase solves real problems, demonstrating
    its simplicity, and building trust through transparency. This is the front
    door to the Kodebase ecosystem and the primary conversion tool for new
    users.
  scope: >
    This initiative focuses on building a static marketing website using Next.js
    with compelling content and design. Includes: Landing page, feature
    exinitiativeations, documentation portal, pricing page, and blog. Excludes:
    User authentication, dashboards, payment processing, and dynamic user
    content.
  success_criteria:
    - Clear value proposition understood within 10 seconds
    - Conversion rate >5% from visit to CLI installation
    - Page load time <1 second globally
    - SEO optimized for "structured development" keywords
    - Accessible and beautiful on all devices

notes:
  content_strategy: >
    Focus on developer pain points: lost context, repeated exinitiativeations,
    and fragmented knowledge. Use concrete examples and scenarios that resonate
    with engineering teams. Show, don't tell - include interactive demos and
    real artifact examples. Balance technical accuracy with approachability.
    Every page should answer: "How does this help me build better software?"

  design_principles: >
    Developer-first aesthetic: clean, modern, with subtle technical touches. Use
    @kodebase/ui components for consistency with the product. Dark mode by
    default with light mode option. Typography-focused design that makes
    documentation beautiful. Animations should be purposeful, not decorative.
    Trust signals through open source badges, GitHub stars, and testimonials.

  conversion_optimization: >
    Multiple CTAs for different user types: "Try CLI" for developers, "See Demo"
    for managers. Progressive disclosure of information - don't overwhelm on
    first visit. Clear onboarding path from landing to first artifact creation.
    Track funnel metrics at each step. A/B test key messages and CTAs for
    continuous improvement.
