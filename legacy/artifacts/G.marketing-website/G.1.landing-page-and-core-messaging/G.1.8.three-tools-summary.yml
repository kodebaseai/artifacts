  summary: >
    Present a comprehensive overview of the 3 core Kodebase tools and how they
    work together to create the complete Kodebase ecosystem. Design:
    .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Section title introducing the "Three Tools, One Vision" concept
    - Tool 1: CLI - description and key features (≤80 words)
    - Tool 2: Web Interface - description and key features (≤80 words)
    - Tool 3: MCP Integration - description and key features (≤80 words)
    - Visual representation of how tools interconnect
    - Each tool has distinctive iconography or illustration
    - Clear explanation of unified workflow across all tools
    - Call-to-action to explore individual tools (future feature pages)
    - Mobile-responsive layout with clean typography
    - Consistent visual hierarchy and spacing

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Creating a separate three-tools component vs reusing vision section"
    - "Static content vs animated sliding divs for visual interest"
    - "Server-side rendering vs client-side animations"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "TypeScript errors with Framer Motion Variants type"
      solution: "Added proper type import and type annotation for slideVariants"
    - challenge: "User requested animated divs instead of initial static implementation"
      solution: "Pivoted to use Framer Motion with useInView hook for slide-up
        animations"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "The vision section was already partially implemented by the user"
    - "Framer Motion integration requires proper TypeScript typing for Variants"
    - "Staggered animations create better visual hierarchy than simultaneous
      ones"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Reused existing vision-section.tsx component instead of creating new"
    - "Added Framer Motion for smooth slide-up animations on scroll"
    - "Created reusable ToolCard component for consistent styling"
    - "Implemented responsive positioning with mobile-first approach"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Framer Motion Variants type must be explicitly imported and typed"
    - "useInView hook with once:true prevents re-triggering animations"
    - "Custom delay values in variants enable staggered animations"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Navigate to landing page and scroll to Three Tools section"
    - "Verify 4 tool cards slide up when image comes into view"
    - "Check responsive layout on mobile and desktop viewports"
    - "Ensure animations trigger only once per page load"

notes: >
  This section should demonstrate that Kodebase isn't just one tool but a
  complete ecosystem. Show how the tools complement each other and create a
  seamless workflow. Prepare ground for the final CTA.
