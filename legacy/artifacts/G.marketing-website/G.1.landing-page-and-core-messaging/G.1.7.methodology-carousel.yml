  summary: >
    Create an interactive carousel showcasing the 3 main movements of the
    Kodebase methodology: Define, Execute, Distill. Each slide contains a brief
    description and supporting imagery. Design:
    .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Interactive carousel with 3 slides for each methodology phase
    - Slide 1 - "Define" - brief description + methodology image
    - Slide 2 - "Execute" - brief description + methodology image
    - Slide 3 - "Distill" - brief description + methodology image
    - Smooth carousel transitions with navigation controls
    - Each slide has clear, actionable description (≤60 words)
    - High-quality imagery representing each methodology phase
    - Auto-advance functionality with manual override
    - Mobile-responsive with touch/swipe support
    - Navigation dots and arrow controls
    - Link to full methodology documentation
    - Consistent styling with other carousel sections

development_process:
  implementation_approach: >
    Implemented scroll-based carousel using Framer Motion's useScroll and
    useTransform hooks. Created a 300vh section height to track user scroll
    progress across three viewport sections, each representing one methodology
    phase. Used sticky positioning for content container with AnimatePresence
    for smooth fade transitions between carousel items.
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Click-based navigation only: Simpler but less engaging than scroll-based
      interaction"
    - "Horizontal scroll snap: More traditional carousel but less integrated
      with vertical page flow"
    - "Intersection Observer API: Lower-level but Framer Motion provides better
      animation integration"
    - "CSS-only transitions: Lighter weight but limited animation capabilities"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "React hooks rule violation when using useTransform inside map functions"
      solution: "Moved transform calculations outside of component render loops and
        used useEffect for scroll tracking"
    - challenge: "Z-index layering issue with text appearing behind background images"
      solution: "Applied proper z-index values (z-3) to content container to ensure
        text visibility"
    - challenge: "Smooth transition timing between scroll positions"
      solution: "Used viewport progress thresholds (0.333, 0.666) to create clean
        breakpoints between movements"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Scroll-based interactions create more immersive user experience than
      traditional carousels"
    - "Framer Motion's declarative API simplifies complex scroll-linked
      animations"
    - "Sticky positioning combined with viewport height sections enables
      parallax-like effects"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Used identical scroll tracking pattern from solution-section.tsx for
      consistency"
    - "Implemented fade animations with y-axis movement for smooth content
      transitions"
    - "Preloaded all background images to prevent visual flashing during
      transitions"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "AnimatePresence with mode='wait' ensures clean transitions between
      carousel items"
    - "useScroll hook with offset configuration provides precise viewport
      tracking"
    - "Combining motion.div opacity with CSS z-index creates layered visual
      effects"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Scroll through methodology section to verify smooth transitions at 33%,
      66%, and 100% scroll progress"
    - "Check text visibility against all three background images (Define,
      Execute, Distill)"
    - "Verify fade in/out animations trigger correctly on index changes"
    - "Test on mobile devices for touch scroll behavior"
    - "Ensure background images preload without flashing"

notes: >
  This should bridge the solution concept with concrete implementation. Focus on
  how the methodology creates the transformation promised in the previous
  section. Keep technical but accessible.
