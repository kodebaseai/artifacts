  summary: >
    Design and build the landing page that clearly communicates Kodebase's value
    proposition. This includes hero section with primary CTA, problem/solution
    narrative, key features grid, and social proof elements. Focus on compelling
    copywriting and visual storytelling.
  deliverables:
    - Next.js marketing site setup
    - Hero section with animated parallax
    - Problem section
    - Philosophy section
    - Methodology section
    - Vision section
    - CTA sections using Tally
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Clear value proposition is understood within 10 seconds of landing
    - Hero section animates at 60 fps and introduces zero cumulative layout
      shift (CLS)
    - Problem section effectively conveys pain points (≥4/5 average clarity
      score in user testing)
    - Philosophy, Methodology, and Vision sections each include an illustrative
      graphic and pass your personal design/content checklist (or a quick peer
      review where possible)
    - CTA sections integrate with Tally; test submission succeeds in latest
      Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, and analytics event "cta_submit" is logged
    - CTA buttons are prominently displayed on desktop and mobile
    - Mobile-responsive design passes manual review on common devices
    - Lighthouse performance score ≥ 95 and page load time < 1 s globally
      (synthetic tests)
    - All copy reviewed against your clarity & tone checklist (optionally
      verified by an external developer if available)
    - Page meets WCAG AA accessibility standards
