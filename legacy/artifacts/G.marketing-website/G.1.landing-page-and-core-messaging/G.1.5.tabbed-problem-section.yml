  summary: >
    Create an interactive tabbed interface presenting the 5 core problems that
    Kodebase solves. Each tab displays a paragraph explanation with a 5-second
    AI robot animation representing the theme. Design:
    .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Five interactive tabs for each problem area
    - Tab 1: Context Decay - explanation + AI robot video
    - Tab 2: Fragmented Workflows - explanation + AI robot video
    - Tab 3: Human-agent Collaboration - explanation + AI robot video
    - Tab 4: Knowledge Distillation - explanation + AI robot video
    - Tab 5: Trust & Governance - explanation + AI robot video
    - Smooth tab transitions with fade in/out animations
    - Videos are optimized 5-second clips (<2MB each)
    - Auto-advance through tabs with pause on hover
    - Mobile responsive with swipe gestures for tab navigation
    - Accessible keyboard navigation and screen reader support

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Radix UI Tabs: Initially considered for familiarity, but decided to
      migrate to Base UI for better alignment with project standards"
    - "CSS-only animations: Considered pure CSS transitions but chose View
      Transition API for smoother, more performant animations"
    - "Fixed background position: Considered static tab styling but chose moving
      background for better user engagement"
    - "JavaScript animation libraries: Considered Framer Motion but chose native
      View Transitions for better performance and smaller bundle"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Base UI TabsListContext missing error during component migration
        from Radix UI"
      solution: "Fixed by properly using TabsList component instead of regular div and
        updating data attributes from data-[state=active] to data-[selected]"
    - challenge: "SVG icons not inheriting color from selected tab state"
      solution: "Added [&_svg]:text-current class to ensure proper color inheritance
        through CSS cascade"
    - challenge: "Video height overflow on md breakpoint not respecting parent
        container max-height"
      solution: "Added responsive max-height classes directly to video element:
        max-h-[60vw] md:max-h-[40vh] lg:max-h-[514px]"
    - challenge: "Background position calculation incorrect after window resize
        causing flash effect"
      solution: "Implemented debounced resize handler with 100ms delay and
        skipViewTransition flag during resize events"
    - challenge: "Moving background position miscalculated on mobile orientation
        (horizontal vs vertical layout)"
      solution: "Added responsive calculation logic detecting screen size with lg
        breakpoint (1024px) and using appropriate transform (translateX vs
        translateY)"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "View Transition API provides superior UX for tab animations compared to
      traditional CSS transitions"
    - "Base UI migration required careful attention to data attribute changes
      (data-[state=active] → data-[selected])"
    - "Responsive design complexity increases significantly when supporting both
      horizontal and vertical orientations"
    - "Debouncing resize events is critical for preventing visual glitches
      during window resizing"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Component-first development: Built reusable Base UI Tabs component before
      implementing specific problem section"
    - "Progressive enhancement: Started with basic functionality, then added
      smooth animations and responsive behavior"
    - "Mobile-first responsive design: Implemented horizontal layout for small
      screens, vertical for desktop"
    - "Performance optimization: Used native View Transitions instead of heavy
      animation libraries"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "View Transition API browser support patterns and fallback strategies for
      older browsers"
    - "Base UI component architecture differences from Radix UI, particularly in
      event handling and data attributes"
    - "CSS cascade behavior with SVG icon color inheritance in complex component
      hierarchies"
    - "Responsive video element constraints and how max-height behaves across
      different container contexts"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified tab switching animations on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari"
    - "Tested responsive behavior across mobile (375px), tablet (768px), and
      desktop (1024px+) breakpoints"
    - "Validated video loading with poster image on slow network connections"
    - "Confirmed debounced resize behavior prevents flashing during window
      resize"
    - "Tested keyboard navigation and focus states for accessibility compliance"

  Videos are already created. Focus on creating engaging copy for each problem
  area that resonates with developer pain points. This section should create
  emotional connection before presenting solutions.
