  summary: >
    Create a 3-part sliding screen solution section with scroll-triggered
    animations. Content fades out as user scrolls, revealing new screens from
    below with fresh content and imagery. Design:
    .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Section title "Your Codebase is Your Knowledge Base" prominently displayed
    - Three distinct "screens" that transition with scroll
    - Screen 1: Introduction to the solution concept + supporting image
    - Screen 2: How it works in practice + supporting image
    - Screen 3: The transformation/outcome + supporting image
    - Smooth fade-out/fade-in animations triggered by scroll position
    - Images are high-quality and optimized for web (<500KB each)
    - Content is concise but compelling (≤80 words per screen)
    - Mobile version adapts gracefully with simplified transitions
    - Scroll position indicators or progress bar
    - Accessibility considerations for motion-sensitive users

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "CSS-only transitions: Considered pure CSS scroll-snap but lacked
      fine-grained control"
    - "GSAP: Popular animation library but adds 90KB+ to bundle size"
    - "Intersection Observer API: Native but less smooth than Framer Motion"
    - "React Spring: Good alternative but Framer Motion already in use"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Scroll offset synchronization with sticky header positioning"
      solution: "Used offset: ['start 16px', 'end start'] to match sticky top-base
        (16px)"
    - challenge: "Exit animation acceleration feeling unnatural"
      solution: "Applied quadratic easing (t * t) and increased travel distance to -150%"
    - challenge: "Floating text elements overlapping on smaller screens"
      solution: "Responsive positioning with md: and lg: breakpoints for text placement"
    - challenge: "Images flashing during transitions"
      solution: "Preloaded all images in useEffect and added eager loading priority"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Framer Motion's useScroll with container refs provides precise scroll
      tracking"
    - "Section height of 320vh creates ideal pacing for three-screen narrative"
    - "Offset values must match CSS sticky positioning for seamless transitions"
    - "Exit animations benefit from acceleration curves vs linear movement"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Used Framer Motion's declarative API for maintainable scroll animations"
    - "Structured content as data array for easy future updates"
    - "Layered absolute positioning for smooth cross-fade effects"
    - "Progressive enhancement: core content visible without JS"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Scroll-triggered animations work best with extended viewport heights
      (3-4x)"
    - "Transform percentages (42% slide-up) create more natural entry than 100%"
    - "Floating UI elements need careful responsive design to avoid overlap"
    - "useTransform with array breakpoints enables complex multi-stage
      animations"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Scroll through entire section checking transition smoothness"
    - "Test on mobile devices for simplified transitions"
    - "Verify images load without flash or layout shift"
    - "Check exit animation acceleration feels natural"
    - "Test with reduced motion preferences enabled"
    - "Verify floating text readability on various screen sizes"

notes: >
  This is where we transition from problem to solution. Each screen should build
  upon the previous, creating a narrative arc that leads naturally to the
  methodology section. Focus on benefits and transformation.
