    experience. Features a carousel showcasing the main pages/screens of the
    Kodebase tools, giving users a comprehensive preview of what Kodebase
    offers. Design: .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing
    page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Interactive carousel with smooth transitions between slides
    - Each slide shows a different Kodebase tool interface/screen
    - Includes CLI interface, artifact management, and methodology views
    - Navigation dots and arrow controls for manual browsing
    - Auto-advance with pause on hover functionality
    - Mobile-responsive carousel with touch/swipe support
    - High-quality screenshots optimized for web display
    - Brief descriptive text for each highlighted feature
    - Smooth animations and loading states for all images

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Implement as static grid layout with hover effects instead of carousel"
    - "Use external carousel library like Swiper.js for advanced features"
    - "Create full-screen modal gallery instead of inline carousel"
    - "Implement as auto-playing video showcasing tool interfaces"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Carousel content alignment with container margins"
      solution: "Used CSS calc() functions to match max-width container behavior with
        ml-[max(var(--spacing-base),calc(50vw-640px))]"
    - challenge: "Conditional padding only for first and last carousel items"
      solution: "Implemented index-based conditional className application using cn()
        utility"
    - challenge: "Maintaining responsive design consistency across breakpoints"
      solution: "Leveraged CSS custom properties with media queries for consistent
        spacing system"

notes: >
  This extends the hero section by giving users a detailed look at the actual
  Kodebase interfaces. Should build excitement and demonstrate the polish of the
  tools. Consider using actual screenshots from the CLI and future web
  interface.
