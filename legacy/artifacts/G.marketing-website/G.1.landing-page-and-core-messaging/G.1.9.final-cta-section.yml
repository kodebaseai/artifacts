  summary: >
    Create the final conversion section with compelling CTA that integrates with
    Tally for early-access signup and feedback capture. This is the destination
    for all scroll-to-CTA buttons throughout the page. Design:
    .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Compelling final headline that summarizes value proposition
    - Clear benefit statements leading to signup form
    - Tally form embedded or modal loads in <500ms
    - Multiple CTA button variants for A/B testing
    - Successful submission event captured with "cta_submit" analytics
    - Thank you state after successful submission
    - Form validation and error handling
    - Mobile and desktop responsive design
    - Social proof elements (testimonials, early adopter count)
    - Secondary CTAs (documentation, blog, social media)

notes: >
  This is the conversion goal for the entire page. All hero CTAs and scroll-to
  buttons should link here. Use environment vars for Tally form IDs per
  environment (prod/staging). Focus on removing friction while building
  excitement for early access.

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Inline Tally embed: Considered directly embedding Tally form but opted
      for button trigger to maintain design control"
    - "Custom form solution: Evaluated building custom form but Tally provides
      better analytics and integrations"
    - "Multiple step form: Considered multi-step approach but single form
      reduces friction for early access"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "CTA section was updated during implementation with new styling
        requirements"
      solution: "Adapted to the new design system with gradient buttons and grid
        background"
    - challenge: "Tally integration approach needed to balance performance with user
        experience"
      solution: "Planned for on-demand loading of Tally form to optimize initial page
        load"
