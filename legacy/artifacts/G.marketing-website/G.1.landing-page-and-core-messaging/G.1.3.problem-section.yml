content:
  summary: >
    Create the main hero section showcasing how developers work with Kodebase
    (alpha version). Features a laptop mockup playing a demo video or
    orchestrated animation of the tools in action, with headline and CTA that
    scrolls to final section. Design: .kodebase/docs/product/design/marketing
    landing page/Homepage.jpg
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Hero section with compelling headline and subtext
    - Laptop mockup with embedded demo video/animation of Kodebase tools
    - Video shows realistic workflow with CLI, artifacts, and methodology
    - Primary CTA button smoothly scrolls to final CTA section (G.1.9)
    - Video is optimized for web (<10MB) and auto-plays on desktop
    - Mobile version shows static screenshot with play button
    - Section responsive across all device sizes
    - Loading states and fallbacks for video content
    - Accessibility controls for video playback

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - SVG-based laptop mockup with embedded base64 images (rejected -
      performance issues)
    - CSS-only laptop design with iframe for video (rejected - responsive issues)
    - Third-party laptop mockup components (rejected - customization limitations)
    - Pure CSS laptop mockup with flexible content area (selected - optimal
      performance and flexibility)
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Massive performance issues with 437KB SVG containing base64 image data"
      solution: "Completely replaced with lightweight CSS-based laptop design using
        Tailwind utilities, reducing from 437KB to ~2KB"
    - challenge: "Import path aliases (@/) not working in test environment causing
        test failures"
      solution: "Test environment configuration issue - aliases work correctly in
        application, tests need path resolution config"
    - challenge: "Creating natural-looking gradient overlay for visual hierarchy"
      solution: "Implemented multi-stop gradient with decreasing opacity
        (from-black/100 via-black/64 via-48% to-transparent)"
    - challenge: "Making responsive spacing system work across all breakpoints"
      solution: "Added CSS custom properties with media queries for each Tailwind
        breakpoint (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Performance optimization can require complete architectural changes -
      sometimes refactoring beats fixing"
    - "CSS-based mockups scale better than SVG+image approaches for responsive
      designs"
    - "Tailwind custom properties with media queries provide powerful responsive
      design systems"
    - "Test environment path resolution can differ from application runtime even
      in monorepos"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Built responsive hero section with CSS Grid layout for optimal
      positioning"
    - "Created reusable LaptopScreen component with children prop for content
      flexibility"
    - "Implemented smooth scroll behavior globally via CSS scroll-behavior
      property"
    - "Used CSS custom properties for responsive spacing across breakpoint
      system"
    - "Applied performance-first approach - removed 437KB SVG, built lightweight
      CSS alternative"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "CSS custom properties with media queries enable sophisticated responsive
      design systems"
    - "Tailwind utility classes can recreate complex designs like laptop mockups
      without external assets"
    - "Performance problems often indicate architectural issues that need
      fundamental solutions"
    - "Gradient overlays with multiple via points create more natural visual
      transitions"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified hero section renders correctly across desktop, tablet, and
      mobile viewports"
    - "Tested smooth scroll functionality from CTA button to target section"
    - "Validated laptop mockup component accepts and displays children content
      properly"
    - "Confirmed responsive spacing adjusts correctly at all Tailwind
      breakpoints"
    - "Tested gradient overlay visual hierarchy and opacity transitions"

notes: >
  This is the main conversion driver. Video should demonstrate actual Kodebase
  workflow - creating artifacts, using CLI, seeing results. Focus on "showing
  not telling" the product value.
