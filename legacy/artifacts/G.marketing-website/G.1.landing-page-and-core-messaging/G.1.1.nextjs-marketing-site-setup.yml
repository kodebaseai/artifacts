  summary: >
    Bootstrap a new Next.js codebase for the marketing website with the required
    tooling, folder structure, and CI setup. Ensure Tailwind CSS and
    @kodebase/ui components are integrated.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - New Next.js 15 app scaffolded in apps/web
    - TypeScript, Biome configured per monorepo standards
    - Tailwind CSS set up with shared design tokens
    - kodebase/ui components imported and a sample page renders
    - Placeholder components for each section
    - CI pipeline (lint, build) passes in GitHub Actions
    - README updated with dev setup instructions

notes: >
  This forms the foundation for all subsequent landing-page work.

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Use a separate repo for marketing site, but monorepo keeps DX consistent"
    - "Create site with Astro, but chose Next.js 15 for first-class React and
      Turbopack support"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Tailwind + @kodebase/ui peer-dependency alignment"
      solution: "Pinned Tailwind 4.x versions across workspace to avoid mismatched
        PostCSS plugins"
    - challenge: "next/font CSS variable setup with two custom fonts"
      solution: "Leveraged next/font/google variable option and applied via body class"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Monorepo tooling (Turborepo, shared TS/Tailwind config) accelerated setup"
    - "Using placeholder components early helps separate structure from later
      visual polish"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Scaffolded Next.js app with Tailwind + UI library"
    - "Added section placeholders as separate components for modularity"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Documented pattern for loading multiple Google fonts via next/font"
    - "Established baseline container / spacing utility classes for marketing
      pages"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Run `pnpm --filter web dev` and verify home page renders all sections"
    - "Check browser console for font-loading and Tailwind class warnings"
    - "Push branch and validate Vercel preview build passes and displays new
      sections"
