  vision: >
    Ensure the first 100 adopters of Kodebase have an exceptional experience
    that turns them into passionate advocates. This program focuses on hands-on
    support, rapid feedback incorporation, and building a tight-knit community
    of early users who shape the product's future. Success with early adopters
    creates the foundation for organic growth and product-market fit.
  scope: >
    This initiative focuses on supporting early adopters through their entire
    journey from discovery to advocacy. Includes: Onboarding support, feedback
    loops, community building, success metrics, and case studies. Excludes: Mass
    marketing, automated support systems, enterprise features, and paid support
    tiers.
  success_criteria:
    - 80% of early adopters actively using Kodebase after 30 days
    - 50+ GitHub stars from organic advocacy
    - 10+ detailed case studies from successful implementations
    - Average response time <2 hours for early adopter issues
    - NPS score >70 from early adopter cohort

notes:
  early_adopter_profile: >
    Target senior developers and tech leads at small-to-medium teams (5-50
    developers) who feel the pain of context loss most acutely. Look for teams
    using Git effectively, practicing code review, and open to methodology
    improvements. Open source maintainers are ideal as they can showcase
    Kodebase publicly. Avoid enterprise teams initially - they need features we
    don't have yet.

  support_philosophy: >
    White glove service for the first 100. Every early adopter should feel like
    they have direct access to the founders. Quick responses, personalized
    onboarding calls, and custom solutions to their specific needs. This doesn't
    scale, but it builds deep understanding and loyalty. Document every
    interaction to build the knowledge base for future self-service.

  feedback_integration: >
    Tight feedback loops with rapid iteration. Weekly releases incorporating
    early adopter suggestions. Public changelog showing their impact. Credit
    contributors in release notes. Make early adopters feel like co-creators,
    not just users. Their success stories become our marketing material.
