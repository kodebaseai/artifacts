  summary: "Establish performance and load testing infrastructure to validate
    system scalability and ensure all performance targets are met under various
    load conditions. Performance benchmarking will validate critical targets: <2
    second individual artifact validation, <30 second full project validation
    for <100 artifacts, <60 second GitHub Actions workflow execution, and <30
    second cascade processing. Scalability testing will evaluate system behavior
    with large artifact sets (100, 500, 1000 artifacts), complex dependency
    graphs with deep nesting, and concurrent processing scenarios. Load testing
    will simulate multiple simultaneous PR validations, high-frequency cascade
    processing, and system behavior under resource constraints. The testing
    framework will include performance benchmarking tools, large-scale test data
    generators, concurrent testing utilities, and resource monitoring/profiling
    tools to ensure the system maintains performance targets and resource
    efficiency even under heavy load."
