  summary: "Implement performance optimization and monitoring infrastructure to
    ensure artifact validation meets strict performance targets: <2 seconds for
    single artifacts, <30 seconds for projects with <100 artifacts, and <60
    seconds for complete GitHub Actions workflows. The system will use
    validation result caching for unchanged artifacts, parallel processing for
    independent validations, and incremental validation for large projects.
    Comprehensive monitoring will track execution times, workflow
    success/failure rates, validation error frequency and types, enabling
    continuous optimization through metrics-driven improvements and resource
    usage profiling."

notes: |
  Performance Targets:
  - Single artifact validation: <2 seconds
  - Full project validation: <30 seconds for <100 artifacts
  - GitHub Actions workflow: <60 seconds total runtime

  Monitoring and Metrics:
  - Track validation execution times with percentile breakdowns
  - Monitor GitHub Actions workflow success/failure rates
  - Log validation error frequency and types for pattern analysis
  - Resource usage profiling (CPU, memory, I/O)

  Optimization Strategies:
  - Validation result caching for unchanged artifacts
  - Parallel validation for independent artifacts using worker pools
  - Incremental validation for large projects (only validate changed artifacts)
  - Smart dependency graph analysis to minimize validation scope

  Technical Implementation:
  - Performance monitoring integration with telemetry
  - Caching system for validation results with TTL management
  - Parallel processing architecture for validation tasks
  - Metrics collection for continuous optimization

  This system ensures validation never becomes a bottleneck in the development workflow while providing insights for continuous improvement.
