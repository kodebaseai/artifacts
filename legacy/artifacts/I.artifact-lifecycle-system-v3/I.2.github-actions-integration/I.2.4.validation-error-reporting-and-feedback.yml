  summary: "Develop a comprehensive error reporting system that provides clear,
    actionable feedback for artifact validation failures across multiple
    channels (CLI, GitHub, web). The system will implement severity levels
    (ERROR blocks merge, WARNING flags for review, INFO provides guidance),
    include specific field references with line numbers, offer exact remediation
    steps, and link to documentation for complex rules. It will track validation
    progress across PR updates showing which errors have been fixed, maintain a
    remediation suggestion database with context-specific advice, and ensure
    consistent error formatting across all validation channels to maximize
    developer productivity through clear guidance."

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Provides specific, actionable error messages with exact remediation steps"
    - "Tracks validation progress across PR updates"
    - "Integrates seamlessly with GitHub PR workflow"
    - "Maintains consistent error format across all validation channels"
    - "Implements severity levels: ERROR (blocks merge), WARNING (flags for
      review), INFO (guidance)"
    - "Provides specific field references with line numbers where applicable"
    - "Includes remediation suggestions with exact steps to fix"
    - "Links to documentation for complex validation rules"
    - "Shows which validation errors have been fixed in PR updates"
    - "Integrates with GitHub status checks with detailed descriptions"
    - "Posts PR comments with formatted validation reports"
    - "Provides CLI output for local validation runs"
    - "Uses structured error format with machine-readable metadata"
    - "Maintains remediation suggestion database with context-specific advice"
    - "Tracks progress between validation runs"
    - "Supports multi-channel output formatting (CLI, GitHub, web)"

  Error Message Structure:
  - Severity levels: ERROR (blocks merge), WARNING (flags for review), INFO (guidance)
  - Specific field references with line numbers where applicable
  - Remediation suggestions with exact steps to fix
  - Links to documentation for complex validation rules

  Progress Tracking:
  - Show which validation errors have been fixed in PR updates
  - Track validation improvement over time
  - Provide diff of validation results between runs

  Integration Points:
  - GitHub status checks with detailed descriptions
  - PR comments with formatted validation reports
  - CLI output for local validation runs

  Technical Specifications:
  - Structured error format with machine-readable metadata
  - Remediation suggestion database with context-specific advice
  - Progress tracking between validation runs
  - Multi-channel output formatting (CLI, GitHub, web)

  This system ensures developers receive clear, actionable feedback regardless of where they encounter validation errors.
