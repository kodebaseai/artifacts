  summary: "Conduct thorough analysis of all existing Kodebase artifacts to develop a comprehensive migration strategy for transitioning to the new PR-based workflow. The analysis will inventory all artifacts in .kodebase/artifacts/, validate current event chains to identify gaps, check compliance with new validation rules, and identify relationship inconsistencies or orphaned references. Based on findings, develop a phased migration strategy prioritizing critical path artifacts, create repair procedures for common issues, plan event backfill for missing correlation chains, and design rollback procedures for migration failures. Risk assessment will identify artifacts that may fail new validation rules, plan for complex dependency relationships, and evaluate impact on ongoing development work. Deliverables include complete artifact inventory with compliance status, detailed migration plan with timelines, risk mitigation strategies, and comprehensive rollback procedures."
