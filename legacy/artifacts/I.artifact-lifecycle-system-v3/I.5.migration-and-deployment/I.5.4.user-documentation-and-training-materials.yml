  summary: "Create comprehensive documentation and training materials enabling
    teams to independently adopt the new PR-based workflow and successfully
    migrate existing projects. The migration guide will provide step-by-step
    procedures for transitioning existing projects, troubleshooting guides for
    common issues, before/after workflow comparisons, and FAQ sections
    addressing user concerns. New workflow documentation will include complete
    CLI command reference with examples, PR-based workflow walkthroughs with
    screenshots, validation error guides with specific remediation steps, and
    best practices for efficient workflow adoption. Training materials will
    feature video tutorials for key workflows (create, submit, review),
    interactive examples with real artifact scenarios, and migration workshop
    materials for team onboarding. The documentation system will integrate live
    examples, searchable knowledge base functionality, and maintain alignment
    with system changes to ensure users have access to current, accurate
    information in their preferred learning format."
