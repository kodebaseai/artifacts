  summary: "Establish production-grade monitoring and support infrastructure to
    ensure operational excellence and enable continuous improvement of the
    artifact lifecycle system. The monitoring system will track performance
    metrics for all workflow operations, monitor error rates with configurable
    alerting thresholds, analyze user adoption patterns and usage metrics, and
    provide a comprehensive system health dashboard for operational visibility.
    User support infrastructure will include error reporting with diagnostic
    information collection, support ticket system integration for complex
    issues, community forums for user collaboration, and clear escalation
    procedures for critical failures. Continuous improvement processes will
    systematically collect and analyze user feedback, optimize performance based
    on actual usage data, and evaluate/prioritize feature requests. The
    infrastructure will maintain operational excellence standards through
    proactive alerting, efficient support workflows, and data-driven
    optimization ensuring the system meets production reliability and
    performance requirements."
