  summary: "Establish comprehensive monitoring and error recovery infrastructure
    for the post-merge processing pipeline to ensure reliability and
    observability. The system will track processing time for each merge event,
    monitor cascade depth and complexity, log all state transitions and event
    generations, and alert on failures or timeouts. It will implement
    intelligent error recovery with exponential backoff for transient failures
    (network issues, git conflicts), generate manual intervention procedures for
    persistent failures, maintain a processing queue for failed operations, and
    provide clear error messages with specific remediation steps. Complete audit
    trails will provide traceability from original PR to final cascade commits,
    performance metrics will enable continuous optimization, and structured
    logging will support debugging and compliance requirements."
