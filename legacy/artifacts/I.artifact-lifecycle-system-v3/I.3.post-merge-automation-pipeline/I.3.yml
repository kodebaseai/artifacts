  summary: "Complete automation of post-merge processing that generates events,
    processes cascades, and maintains system consistency based on the event
    system rules defined in I.1.1"

  deliverables:
    - "I.3.1: Automated Event Generation Engine - Smart event creation based on
      merged artifact content analysis"
    - "I.3.2: Cascade Processing Engine - Automatic cascade detection and
      processing based on established cascade rules"
    - "I.3.3: State Consistency and Integrity Validation - Post-processing
      validation to ensure system integrity"
    - "I.3.4: Automated Commit Generation and Git Integration - Commit
      cascade-generated events back to main branch automatically"
    - "I.3.5: Processing Monitoring and Error Recovery - Comprehensive
      monitoring and error recovery for post-merge processing"

  validation:
    - "100% automatic event generation for merged artifacts"
    - "Complete cascade processing in <30 seconds"
    - "Zero manual intervention for standard cascades"
    - "Full audit trail for all automated actions"
    - "Correctly determines state transitions based on content analysis"
    - "Implements all cascade rules from event-cascade.md specification"
    - "Ensures 100% state consistency after all processing completes"
    - "Successfully commits all cascade events back to main branch"
