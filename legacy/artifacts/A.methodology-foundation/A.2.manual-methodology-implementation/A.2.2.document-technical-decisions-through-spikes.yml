content:
  summary: >
    Create spike artifacts for all significant technical decisions during
    development. This includes technology choices, architecture patterns, and
    implementation strategies.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Spike template created with sections:
        - Problem Statement
        - Decision Criteria
        - Options Investigated
        - Analysis (pros/cons)
        - Decision & Rationale
        - Implementation Plan
        - Validation Approach
        - Related Issues
        - Metadata (author, dates, status)
    - Minimum 5 spikes documented covering:
        - Package structure decision
        - Testing framework choice
        - State management approach
        - Error handling strategy
        - Build tooling selection
    - Decision rationale includes:
        - Clear problem context
        - Evaluation criteria weights
        - Trade-off analysis
        - Long-term implications
    - Alternatives documented with:
        - Option description
        - Pros and cons list
        - Why rejected reasoning
        - Could revisit conditions
    - Time-boxing enforced:
        - Each spike has defined time limit
        - Actual time tracked
        - Extension justification if needed
        - Lessons on estimation accuracy
    - Issue linkage established:
        - Spikes reference originating issues
        - Issues reference spike decisions
        - Bidirectional traceability
        - Implementation validates spike

notes: >
  Spikes live in .kodebase/docs/engineering/spikes/ as markdown files. They are
  NOT artifacts but supporting documentation. Reference: A.1.4 for spike
  framework specification.
