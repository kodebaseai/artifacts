        reason: This was partially done in A.2.1 - we added the metrics. For now this
          will be enough

  summary: >
    Set up and use a time tracking system to measure the actual effort required
    for each phase of the methodology. This data will validate estimations and
    inform process improvements.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Time tracking method established:
        - Simple CSV or JSON format defined
        - Storage location determined
        - Entry creation process documented
        - Tools selected (manual or app)
    - Data captured for all issues includes:
        - Issue ID reference
        - Start and end timestamps
        - Phase identification (planning/coding/review)
        - Interruption tracking
        - Context switch counts
    - Phase breakdown tracking:
        - Planning phase: artifact creation, acceptance criteria
        - Implementation phase: coding, testing, debugging
        - Review phase: PR creation, feedback cycles
        - Administrative: status updates, event logging
    - Estimation accuracy analysis:
        - Original estimate (XS/S/M/L/XL)
        - Actual hours spent
        - Variance calculation
        - Patterns identified
        - Calibration recommendations
    - Overhead metrics calculated:
        - Methodology overhead percentage
        - Pure coding time vs process time
        - Context switching cost
        - Meeting and communication time
    - Reports generated including:
        - Per-issue time breakdown
        - Phase distribution charts
        - Estimation accuracy trends
        - Overhead analysis
        - Productivity insights

notes: >
  Keep tracking lightweight to avoid tracking becoming overhead itself. Focus on
  actionable metrics that inform automation priorities. Consider using toggl,
  clockify, or simple spreadsheet.
