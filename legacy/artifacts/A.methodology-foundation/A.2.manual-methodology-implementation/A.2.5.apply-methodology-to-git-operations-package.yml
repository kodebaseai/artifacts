  summary: >
    Use the methodology to develop the @kodebase/git-ops package. This will test
    the methodology's effectiveness for infrastructure-type development work.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Full artifact hierarchy created:
        - Initiative for git-ops package
        - Milestones for major features
        - Issues for each component
        - All properly linked and sequenced
    - Branch automation patterns tested:
        - Auto-creation on checkout
        - Naming convention validation
        - Protection rule compliance
        - Clean-up procedures
    - Hook implementations tracked:
        - post-checkout hook (in_progress trigger)
        - pre-commit hook (message validation)
        - post-merge hook (completion trigger)
        - Hook installation process
    - Methodology compliance verified:
        - All commits reference issues
        - State transitions logged
        - Events properly cascaded
        - Documentation updated
    - Integration points documented:
        - How git-ops enables automation
        - Hook and CLI interaction
        - Error handling patterns
        - Recovery procedures
    - Lessons learned captured:
        - What worked well
        - Pain points encountered
        - Deviations required
        - Improvement suggestions

notes: >
  The git-ops package is meta - it helps automate the methodology itself. Pay
  special attention to bootstrapping challenges. Location: packages/git-ops/
