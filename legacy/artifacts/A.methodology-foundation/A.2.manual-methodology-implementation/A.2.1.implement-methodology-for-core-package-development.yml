  summary: >
    Apply the full methodology to develop the @kodebase/core package. Create the
    typescript models, schemas, parser and utils that will allow other packages
    to interact with our /.kodebase/ folder. Follow the complete lifecycle for
    schema implementation, validation logic, and shared utilities.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Initiative artifact for core package includes:
        - Clear vision statement for the package
        - Defined scope boundaries
        - Success criteria metrics
        - Architecture decisions documented
    - Milestone artifacts created for:
        - Schema definitions milestone
        - Validation logic milestone
        - Shared utilities milestone
        - Each with proper deliverables and validation criteria
    - Issue artifacts include:
        - One issue per component/module
        - Clear acceptance criteria for each
        - Proper estimation (XS/S/M/L/XL)
        - Dependencies mapped (blocks/blocked_by)
    - Git workflow compliance:
        - Branch names match pattern: <issue-id>
        - All branches created with git checkout -b
        - Draft PRs created immediately on branch creation
    - Commit message compliance:
        - Every commit prefixed with issue ID
        - Format: "A.2.1.X: type: description"
        - Structural commits separate from behavioral
        - Clear commit messages explaining "why"
    - Time tracking captures:
        - Planning time per artifact
        - Implementation time per issue
        - Review and refinement time
        - Context switching overhead
    - Friction points documented:
        - Manual YAML editing challenges
        - State transition pain points
        - Repetitive tasks identified
        - Automation opportunities noted

notes: >
  This is our first real application of the methodology. Document everything,
  especially what feels cumbersome or could be automated. Core package location:
  packages/core/
