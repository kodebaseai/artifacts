  summary: >
    Apply the documented methodology manually to all Kodebase development work.
    This involves using the full artifact lifecycle for every new development
    issue, following the initiativening hierarchy rigorously, documenting all
    technical decisions through spikes, and maintaining 100% compliance with the
    issue lifecycle. This real-world application will validate the methodology's
    practicality and reveal friction points.
  deliverables:
    - Completed artifact files for all development work
    - Technical spike documentation
    - Manual workflow documentation
    - Time tracking metrics
  validation:
    - Every commit follows methodology
    - All issues have proper artifacts
    - Decision history is traceable

notes:
  implementation_approach: >
    This milestone focuses on dogfooding the methodology through actual
    development work. Each issue represents applying the methodology to a
    specific aspect of Kodebase development. Time tracking and friction
    documentation are crucial for informing future automation.
