  summary: >
    Create the foundational AGENTIC documents that establish both the rules
    (Constitution) and processes (Methodology) for AI agents and developers
    working within Kodebase. These documents work together to provide complete
    guidance.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Prime Directive section includes:
        - The MVP is Law
        - Reject Complexity
        - Local-First, Always
        - No Gold-Plating
        - YAGNI principle
    - Law of Requirements includes:
        - The Issue is the Whole Truth
        - The Law of Shared Language (GLOSSARY.md requirement)
        - Question Ambiguity
        - Respect the Hierarchy (Initiative -> Milestone -> Issue)
        - Acceptance Criteria as Specification
    - Law of Implementation includes:
        - The Codebase is the Ground Truth
        - No Magic Strings or Numbers
        - Types are Non-Negotiable
        - Single Responsibility
        - Dependencies Flow Inward
        - Prioritize Context Capture
        - Separate Structure from Behavior
        - Test-Driven Changes (Red-Green-Refactor)
    - Law of Interaction includes:
        - One Issue, One Branch
        - Commits Tell a Story
        - Documentation is Part of the Issue
    - Law of Self-Correction includes:
        - Acknowledge Before Acting
        - The Agent Proposes, The Human Approves
        - Learn from Correction
    - Core philosophy section explains:
        - Git repository as structured, event-driven database
        - Artifacts as YAML files
        - Events as immutable, append-only logs
        - Identity management (human vs AI agent patterns)
    - Artifact storage conventions include:
        - Folder structure - /.kodebase/artifacts/
        - Milestone-oriented organization
        - Naming conventions for each artifact type
        - File format (YAML) and extensions
    - Complete artifact lifecycle includes all states:
        - draft → ready → in_progress → in_review → completed → archived
        - Trigger conditions for each transition
        - Validation rules for each state change
        - Cascade effects on parent/child artifacts
    - Git workflow integration includes:
        - Branch naming - <artifact-id>
        - Commit conventions - artifact-id:type:message format
        - Git hooks (post-checkout, pre-push)
        - PR automation triggers
    - Quality gates include:
        - In Progress to In Review checklist
        - Test coverage requirements (80%)
        - Documentation requirements
    - TDD workflow includes:
        - Red-Green-Refactor cycle
        - One test per acceptance criterion
        - Structural vs behavioral commits

notes: >
  These documents already exist but need terminology updates (Plans→Initiatives,
  Tasks→Issues). Reference existing files: - Current Constitution:
  ./AGENTIC_CONSTITUTION.mdc - Current Methodology:
  ./AGENTIC_KODEBASE_METHODOLOGY.mdc - Instructions: ./AGENTIC_INSTRUCTIONS.mdc

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Could have created documents from scratch, but existing documents already
      had correct terminology"
    - "Considered restructuring the laws, but maintained existing structure for
      consistency"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "MultiEdit tool only applied first section of changes"
      solution: "Completed remaining edits using individual Edit commands"
    - challenge: "Formatting examples to be clear while maintaining document flow"
      solution: "Used consistent Good/Bad example format with arrow notation for clarity"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Documents already used correct terminology
      (Issues/Milestones/Initiatives)"
    - "Adding concrete examples significantly improves understanding of abstract
      principles"
    - "Good/Bad example format effectively demonstrates correct vs incorrect
      implementations"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Systematic review of both documents against acceptance criteria"
    - "Added 2 examples per rule using consistent formatting"
    - "Verified all acceptance criteria met before completion"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Constitution examples serve as practical reference for agent behavior"
    - "Clear examples reduce ambiguity in rule interpretation"
    - "Methodology document provides comprehensive workflow guidance"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Review AGENTIC_CONSTITUTION.mdc for concrete examples in each law"
    - "Verify all 5 law sections have at least 2 Good/Bad examples each"
    - "Confirm terminology uses Issues/Milestones/Initiatives throughout"
    - "Check AGENTIC_KODEBASE_METHODOLOGY.mdc has all required sections"
    - "Validate acceptance criteria are fully met in both documents"
