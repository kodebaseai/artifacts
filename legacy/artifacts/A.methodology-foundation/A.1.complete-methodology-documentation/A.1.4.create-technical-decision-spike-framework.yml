  summary: >
    Document the spike process for technical decisions and explorations. Spikes
    are NOT artifacts but a separate documentation framework that lives in
    .kodebase/docs/engineering/spikes/ to capture technical decisions and their
    rationale.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Spike documentation structure defined:
        - Location: .kodebase/docs/engineering/spikes/
        - Format: Markdown documents
        - Naming: decision-title.md
        - Template: spike-template.md
    - Spike template includes sections:
        - Problem Statement
        - Decision Criteria
        - Options Investigated
        - Analysis (pros/cons per option)
        - Decision & Rationale
        - Implementation Plan
        - Validation Approach
        - Related Issues (links to artifacts)
        - Metadata section at end with:
            - Author(s)
            - Created date
            - Last updated date
            - Originating issue/milestone ID
            - Decision status (proposed/accepted/superseded)
            - Stakeholders consulted
            - Review/approval details
            - Tags/categories for searchability
    - Spike types documented:
        - Research Spike (investigate without building)
        - Proof of Concept Spike (build to validate)
        - Comparison Spike (evaluate specific alternatives)
    - Time-boxing guidelines:
        - Research Spike: 1-3 days
        - Proof of Concept: 2-5 days
        - Comparison Spike: 1-2 days
    - Integration patterns documented:
        - How issues trigger spikes (uncertainty encountered)
        - How spikes generate issues (approach identified)
        - Bidirectional linking between spikes and issues
        - Multiple issues can reference same spike
    - Quality gates defined:
        - Spike creation checklist
        - Spike completion criteria
        - Implementation validation steps
    - Decision tracking framework:
        - How to reference spikes in issues
        - When spike is required vs optional
        - Validation during implementation
    - Example spike document created:
        - Real technical decision example
        - Shows all template sections filled
        - Demonstrates issue linking
        - Includes complete metadata section
        - Shows how to track decision evolution

notes: >
  Spikes are NOT artifacts in the Kodebase planning system. They are separate
  technical documentation that lives in .kodebase/docs/engineering/spikes/. They
  provide decision rationale and link to implementation issues. Reference:
  .kodebase/docs/engineering/spikes/README.md

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Template-only approach: Just creating a template without comprehensive
      documentation"
    - "Integration with artifact system: Making spikes part of the planning
      artifacts"
    - "External tool integration: Using separate spike management tools"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Balancing comprehensiveness with simplicity in the template structure"
      solution: "Focused on essential sections while allowing optional extensions"
    - challenge: "Ensuring clear distinction between spikes and artifacts to avoid
        confusion"
      solution: "Added clear header documentation explaining spikes are exploratory,
        not work items"
    - challenge: "Creating realistic example that demonstrates all template sections
        effectively"
      solution: "Used API framework decision as it touches all aspects: requirements,
        options, trade-offs"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Spikes serve as knowledge capture mechanism separate from planning
      artifacts"
    - "Structured template ensures consistent decision documentation across team"
    - "Real example (AI agent Git identity) demonstrates practical application"
    - "Integration patterns enable seamless workflow between spikes and issues"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Built comprehensive template covering all acceptance criteria sections"
    - "Enhanced existing _README.md with complete framework documentation"
    - "Created realistic example spike showing proper template usage"
    - "Documented decision tracking and quality gates for spike process"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Clear distinction between spikes (technical decisions) and artifacts
      (planning)"
    - "Time-boxing guidelines for different spike types maintain development
      velocity"
    - "Bidirectional linking pattern between spikes and issues enables
      traceability"
    - "Structured metadata section enables searchability and decision tracking"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified all template sections align with acceptance criteria"
    - "Confirmed example spike demonstrates complete metadata usage"
    - "Tested spike file naming convention with kebab-case format"
    - "Validated integration patterns documentation against workflow
      requirements"
