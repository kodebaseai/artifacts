  summary: >
    Create detailed documentation of how Git operations integrate with the
    artifact lifecycle. This includes branch naming, commit conventions, and
    hook implementations.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Branch naming conventions:
        - Format: <artifact-id>
        - Examples: A.1.6
        - Special branches: main
        - Protection rules for main branch
    - Commit message templates:
        - Feature: "<artifact-id>: feat: <description>"
        - Fix: "<artifact-id>: fix: <description>"
        - Refactor: "<artifact-id>: refactor: <description>"
        - Test: "<artifact-id>: test: <description>"
        - Docs: "<artifact-id>: docs: <description>"
    - Git hook triggers documented:
        - post-checkout: marks artifact in_progress
        - pre-commit: validates commit message
        - pre-push: checks artifact state
        - post-merge: marks artifact completed
    - PR workflow integration:
        - Draft PR creation on branch checkout
        - PR title format: "[<artifact-id>] <title>"
        - PR description template with checklist
        - Review requirements (approvals)
        - Merge strategies per artifact type
    - Merge strategies:
        - Issues: squash and merge (clean history)
        - Milestones: merge commit (preserve context)
        - Initiatives: merge commit with tags
        - Hotfixes: cherry-pick to main
    - Visual workflow diagrams:
        - Git flow with artifact states
        - Hook trigger sequence diagram
        - PR lifecycle flowchart
        - Branch strategy visualization

notes: >
  Git hooks are the primary automation mechanism for state transitions.
  Reference: .kodebase/docs/for-agents/tooling/git-integration.mdc Hooks
  implementation: .kodebase/hooks/

development_process:
  implementation_approach: >
    Updated the existing comprehensive Git workflow documentation at
    .kodebase/docs/for-agents/methodology/process-automation/git-workflow.md
    rather than creating a new file. This approach leveraged the existing solid
    foundation while adding the specific missing requirements from the
    acceptance criteria. The documentation was enhanced with conventional commit
    templates, detailed merge strategies, enhanced hook documentation, and
    comprehensive visual diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

  alternatives_considered:
    - Creating a new git-integration.mdc file - Rejected to avoid duplication
    - Splitting into multiple files - Rejected to maintain cohesive reference
    - Using external diagramming tools - Rejected in favor of Mermaid for
      Git-native docs

  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Ensuring all acceptance criteria were comprehensively covered while
        building on existing documentation"
      solution: "Carefully mapped requirements to existing content and identified
        specific gaps to fill"
    - challenge: "Creating visual diagrams that are informative without being
        overwhelming"
      solution: "Used clear information hierarchy and focused on essential workflows"

completion_analysis:
  summary: >
    Successfully enhanced the Git integration documentation to provide complete
    coverage of all Git workflow patterns in the Kodebase methodology. The
    documentation now serves as a comprehensive reference for branch naming,
    commit conventions, hook implementations, PR workflows, merge strategies,
    and visual workflow understanding.

  key_insights:
    - Visual diagrams significantly improve understanding of complex workflows
    - Conventional commit templates with artifact IDs provide clear traceability
    - Different merge strategies for different artifact types optimize for their
      purpose
    - Comprehensive hook documentation enables proper team deployment
    - Event cascade visualization helps understand methodology automation

  implementation_approach: >
    Enhanced existing documentation by adding missing conventional commit
    templates, detailed merge strategies per artifact type, comprehensive hook
    documentation including pre-commit and pre-push validation, and visual
    workflow diagrams using Mermaid. Maintained consistency with existing
    patterns while ensuring complete coverage of all acceptance criteria.

  knowledge_generated: >
    Comprehensive Git integration patterns documentation that covers branch
    naming conventions, commit message templates, hook implementations, PR
    workflows, merge strategies, and visual workflow diagrams. This
    documentation enables teams to understand and implement the Git-native
    Kodebase methodology with clear automation patterns and visual understanding
    of complex workflows.

  manual_testing_steps:
    - Verified all acceptance criteria requirements are documented
    - Confirmed branch naming conventions are clearly specified
    - Validated commit message templates include conventional commit format
    - Checked hook documentation covers all four hook types
    - Ensured PR workflow integration is comprehensively documented
    - Verified merge strategies are specified for all artifact types
    - Confirmed visual diagrams provide clear workflow understanding
