  summary: >
    Create a comprehensive glossary of all Kodebase terminology. Every concept
    used in the methodology must be clearly defined to ensure consistent
    understanding.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - Artifact types defined:
        - Initiative: high-level strategic goal
        - Milestone: major deliverable within initiative
        - Issue: specific work item within milestone
    - Event terminology includes:
        - Event: state change record
        - Event type: draft, ready, blocked, etc.
        - Cascade: automatic state propagation
        - Correlation ID: links related events
        - Parent event: trigger for cascade
    - Git integration terms include:
        - Feature branch: artifact-id based branch
        - Conventional commit: structured message
        - Git hook: automation trigger
        - Draft PR: in-progress visibility
    - Methodology concepts include:
        - Acceptance criteria: testable requirements
        - TDD: test-driven development cycle
        - Artifact lifecycle: state progression
        - Quality gates: transition checkpoints
        - Context capture: knowledge preservation
    - Cross-references format:
        - See also: [ related term ]
        - Related: [ term1, term2 ]
        - Parent concept: [ broader term ]
        - Examples in: [ artifact reference ]
    - Alphabetical organization with:
        - Letter headers (A, B, C...)
        - Consistent formatting
        - Term in bold
        - Clear, concise definitions

notes: >
  The glossary is referenced by the Constitution (Law II.2) and must be kept
  current. Location: .kodebase/docs/GLOSSARY.md All new concepts must be added
  before implementation.

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - Keeping existing glossary minimal vs. comprehensive expansion
    - Different organizational structures (topical vs. alphabetical)
    - Separate files for different term categories vs. single file
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Ensuring all methodology terms from 3+ documents were captured"
      solution: "Systematically reviewed each document section by section to extract
        terms"
    - challenge: "Maintaining alphabetical organization while preserving existing terms"
      solution: "Used careful insertion points to maintain order without disrupting
        existing entries"
    - challenge: "Balancing comprehensive coverage with concise, clear definitions"
      solution: "Focused on practical understanding over theoretical completeness"
    - challenge: "Avoiding duplicate terms while integrating new and existing content"
      solution: "Cross-referenced existing glossary before adding each new term"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - Constitutional Law II.2 requires shared language for consistent
      implementation
    - The glossary serves as the definitive source for agent and human alignment
    - Comprehensive coverage prevents misinterpretation of methodology concepts
    - Clear cross-references enhance understanding of term relationships
  implementation_approach:
    - Analyzed all methodology documents to extract missing terms
    - Organized alphabetically with letter headers for easy navigation
    - Used consistent formatting with bold terms and concise definitions
    - Preserved all existing terms while adding 60+ new critical definitions
  knowledge_generated:
    - Complete terminology mapping for the Kodebase methodology
    - Clear understanding of artifact lifecycle and event system relationships
    - Comprehensive reference enabling consistent agent implementation
    - Foundation for future CLI automation and tooling development
  manual_testing_steps:
    - Verified all acceptance criteria terms are included and properly defined
    - Confirmed alphabetical organization with letter headers
    - Checked consistent formatting (bold terms, clear definitions)
    - Validated cross-references use proper format
    - Ensured no duplicate entries exist
    - Verified Constitutional Law II.2 compliance
