  summary: >
    Establish the complete documentation foundation for the Kodebase
    methodology. This includes comprehensive issue lifecycle documentation with
    Git integration patterns, YAML templates for all artifact types
    (initiatives, milestones, issues), a technical decision framework using the
    spike process, and clear agentic rules for AI assistant collaboration. All
    documentation will be structured to enable future CLI automation.
  deliverables:
    - AGENTIC_CONSTITUTION.mdc
    - AGENTIC_KODEBASE_METHODOLOGY.mdc
    - Artifact schema definitions
    - Event cascade specifications
  validation:
    - All concepts defined in GLOSSARY.md
    - Templates tested with real examples
    - Git workflow documented step-by-step

  key_achievements:
    - "Complete Agent Constitution with 5 core laws and concrete examples
      governing AI development"
    - "Comprehensive artifact schema system with JSON validation for
      initiatives, milestones, and issues"
    - "Event cascade system with correlation IDs enabling complete state
      transition traceability"
    - "Technical decision framework using spike process separate from planning
      artifacts"
    - "Complete glossary with 60+ critical terminology definitions ensuring
      shared language"
    - "Git integration patterns with branch naming, commit conventions, and PR
      workflows"

      consistency"
  strategic_decisions:
    - "Metadata structure: Moved relationships and events inside metadata
      section for better organization"
    - "Schema inheritance: Implemented shared metadata schema with type-specific
      extensions"
    - "Event-driven architecture: Established correlation IDs and parent event
      linking for traceability"
    - "Git-native approach: Leveraged repository as structured database rather
      than external tooling"
    - "Separation of concerns: Kept spikes as technical documentation separate
      from planning artifacts"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Event cascade specifications for automated state transitions"

notes:
  issue_breakdown_rationale: >
    Each deliverable is broken into focused issues that can be completed in 1-2
    days. The AGENTIC documents are split into initial drafts and refinement
    phases. Schema definitions are grouped by artifact type. Event
    specifications get their own issue due to complexity.
