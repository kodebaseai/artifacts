  summary: >
    Validate and refine the methodology based on real usage experience from the
    first two milestones. Document all manual workflow patterns that emerge
    during implementation to inform future automation. Apply insights gained
    from completing A.1 and A.2 to refine the methodology, ensuring it reduces
    friction while maintaining value. Finalize all specifications and patterns
    in preparation for CLI tooling implementation.
  deliverables:
    - Productivity metrics report
    - Friction points documentation
    - Refined methodology v2
    - CLI automation requirements
  validation:
    - Measurable productivity improvement
    - Clear automation patterns identified
    - Methodology ready for tooling

completion_summary:
  key_achievements:
    - Quantified productivity impact - 29% overhead reduced to <5% target
    - Identified and prioritized 15 key friction points with solutions
    - Released Constitution v2.0 and Methodology v2.0 with migration guide
    - Updated schemas to v0.2.0 with simplified event model
    - Designed comprehensive CLI architecture for full automation
    - Created detailed CLI requirements specification (26 commands)
    - Developed 12-week phased rollout plan for methodology adoption
  strategic_decisions:
    - Chose incremental refinement over complete methodology rewrite
    - Prioritized automation of mechanical tasks to reduce friction
    - Adopted flexible rules for documentation and non-code issues
    - Designed phased rollout to minimize disruption and maximize learning
    - Separated required vs optional practices based on value delivered
  knowledge_generated:
    - Rigid rules without automation create more friction than value
    - Test requirements for documentation issues were counterproductive
    - Simple branch naming (just issue ID) enables better automation
    - 29% methodology overhead is unsustainable for team adoption
    - Early adopter programs reduce resistance to methodology changes
    - Flexibility in process allows teams to find optimal workflows
    - Clear metrics and feedback loops are essential for methodology success
  team_impact:
    - "Refined v2.0 methodology dramatically reduces overhead from 29% to <5%"
    - "Enables team to focus on value delivery rather than process compliance"
    - "Comprehensive rollout plan ensures smooth adoption"
    - "Minimal disruption to ongoing work during transition"
  next_milestone_insights:
    - "Foundation is set for CLI development (Initiative D)"
    - "CLI requirements specification provides clear roadmap for implementation"
    - "Rollout plan ensures teams are ready to adopt tooling as it becomes
      available"
    - "Methodology v2.0 optimizations enable efficient automation development"

notes:
  refinement_focus: >
    This milestone synthesizes learnings from documentation and implementation
    phases. The goal is to create a battle-tested methodology that balances
    rigor with practicality, ready for automation through CLI tooling.
