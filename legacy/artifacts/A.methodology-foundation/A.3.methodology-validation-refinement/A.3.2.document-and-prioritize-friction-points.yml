  summary: >
    Create comprehensive documentation of all friction points discovered during
    manual implementation. Prioritize these by impact and frequency to guide
    refinements.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - All friction points catalogued with:
        - Clear problem description
        - When it occurs in workflow
        - Who is affected (developer/reviewer/PM)
        - Example scenarios
        - Current workarounds used
    - Impact severity assessment includes:
        - Time cost per occurrence (minutes)
        - Frustration level (1-5)
        - Error probability increase
        - Flow interruption severity
        - Downstream effects
    - Frequency data collected:
        - Occurrences per issue
        - Daily/weekly frequency
        - Affected artifact types
        - User segments impacted
        - Trend analysis
    - Root cause analysis performed:
        - Why does this friction exist
        - Design decision that led to it
        - Technical constraints involved
        - Process dependencies
        - Missing tooling identified
    - Prioritization matrix created:
        - Impact vs Frequency quadrant
        - Cost to fix estimate
        - Value delivered score
        - Dependencies mapped
        - Implementation order
    - Quick wins identified:
        - Can fix in < 1 day
        - No breaking changes
        - High value/effort ratio
        - Independent of other fixes
        - Immediate user benefit

notes: >
  Source data from A.2.3 manual workflow documentation. Create actionable list
  for CLI development priorities. Output:
  .kodebase/docs/metrics/friction-analysis.md

development_process:
  implementation_approach: >
    Consolidated friction points from multiple sources including
    FRICTION_POINTS.md, methodology metrics report, productivity analysis, and
    git workflow documentation. Created comprehensive catalog of 20 distinct
    friction points across 7 categories. Developed multi-dimensional impact
    assessment using time cost, frustration level, error probability, flow
    interruption, and downstream effects. Built prioritization matrix using
    impact vs frequency quadrant analysis.
  alternatives_considered:
    - Simple list format vs structured analysis (chose structured for
      actionability)
    - Focusing only on high-impact items vs comprehensive catalog (chose
      comprehensive)
    - Technical-only analysis vs including human factors (chose holistic
      approach)
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: Quantifying subjective factors like frustration and flow interruption
      solution: Created multi-dimensional scoring matrix with clear criteria for each
        factor
    - challenge: Balancing detail with readability in a comprehensive report
      solution: Used structured sections with executive summary and detailed breakdowns
    - challenge: Determining realistic effort estimates for fixes without
        implementation experience
      solution: Based estimates on similar work from A.2 implementation and industry
        standards

completion_analysis:
  summary: >
    Successfully created comprehensive friction analysis documenting 20 distinct
    friction points with detailed impact assessments, frequency data, root cause
    analysis, and prioritized implementation roadmap. Identified quick wins that
    can reduce overhead by 280 minutes per week with only 16 hours of
    implementation effort.
  key_insights:
    - 95% of manual effort is automatable
    - Event management and state transitions represent highest impact
      opportunities
    - Quick wins can provide immediate 4.6 hours/week time savings
    - Methodology overhead of 29% can be reduced to under 5% with automation
    - Design decisions created intentional friction that served its purpose
  implementation_approach: >
    Systematic analysis following acceptance criteria structure. Used existing
    data from A.2 implementation experience, extracted patterns from multiple
    documents, and created actionable prioritization based on ROI calculations.
  knowledge_generated:
    - Comprehensive friction point catalog for future reference
    - Prioritization framework applicable to other process improvements
    - Clear automation roadmap with dependency mapping
    - Quantified impact data for investment justification
  manual_testing_steps:
    - Verified all referenced friction points exist in source documents
    - Cross-checked time estimates with A.2.7 metrics report data
    - Validated priority ordering against impact and frequency scores
    - Confirmed quick wins are truly achievable in under 1 day
