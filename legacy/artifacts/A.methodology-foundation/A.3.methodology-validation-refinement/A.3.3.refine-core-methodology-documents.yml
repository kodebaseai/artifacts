        - Successful patterns codified
        - Ambiguities clarified
        - Real examples added
        - Gotchas documented
    - Simplified workflows implemented:
        - Remove unnecessary steps
        - Combine redundant processes
        - Streamline state transitions
        - Reduce required fields
        - Automate obvious decisions
    - Edge cases addressed:
        - Circular dependencies
        - Orphaned artifacts
        - Incomplete cascades
        - State conflicts
        - Recovery procedures
    - Clarifications added for:
        - Confusing terminology
        - Overlapping concepts
        - Decision criteria
        - Role responsibilities
        - Tool boundaries
    - Version 2.0 release includes:
        - Semantic versioning applied
        - Breaking changes documented
        - Migration guide provided
        - Deprecation notices
        - Compatibility notes
    - Change log documents:
        - What changed and why
        - Impact on existing workflows
        - Benefits of changes
        - Known limitations
        - Future considerations

notes: >
  This is our chance to fix what didn't work in practice. Be bold about
  simplifying - if it added no value, remove it. Maintain backwards
  compatibility where possible.

development_process:
  implementation_approach: >
    Analyzed friction analysis (A.3.2) and productivity metrics (A.3.1) to
    identify key pain points. Created v2.0 versions of both core documents with
    targeted refinements. Focused on reducing manual overhead while preserving
    core benefits. Created comprehensive changelog and migration guide for
    smooth transition.
  alternatives_considered:
    - Complete rewrite vs incremental refinement (chose incremental)
    - Removing states vs simplifying transitions (chose simplifying)
    - Mandatory automation vs optional helpers (chose optional to start)
    - Single document vs separate changelog (chose separate for clarity)
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: Balancing simplification with maintaining rigor
      solution: Used friction data to guide decisions, keeping rules that prevent
        errors while removing those that add overhead
    - challenge: Deciding which rules to relax vs preserve
      solution: Applied "value vs friction" test - preserved quality standards,
        relaxed process ceremony
    - challenge: Making migration path clear without overwhelming teams
      solution: Created step-by-step guide with quick wins first and gradual adoption
        path

completion_analysis:
  summary: >
    Successfully refined both core methodology documents to v2.0, addressing all
    major friction points while maintaining the core philosophy. Created
    comprehensive documentation of changes and clear migration path. The refined
    methodology should reduce overhead from 29% to under 5% when combined with
    automation.
  key_insights:
    - Rigid rules created more friction than value for non-code issues
    - Test requirements for documentation were counterproductive
    - Branch naming simplification enables better automation
    - Flexibility in commit style maintains clarity without overhead
    - Progressive enhancement principle allows gradual adoption
  implementation_approach: >
    Systematic review of each section against friction data. Added new
    "Practical Balance" section to Constitution acknowledging real-world needs.
    Streamlined Methodology to focus on what developers do, not process details.
    Created actionable migration guide with concrete examples.
  knowledge_generated:
    - Clear delineation of required vs flexible practices
    - Pragmatic quality guidelines matching issue types
    - Quick reference materials for easy adoption
    - Comprehensive changelog documenting all decisions
    - One-page migration cheat sheet for teams
  manual_testing_steps:
    - Reviewed all changes against friction points from A.3.2
    - Verified no breaking changes to core philosophy
    - Checked migration guide covers common scenarios
    - Validated quick reference accuracy
    - Ensured backwards compatibility where claimed
