  summary: >
    Create MCP tools for listing and browsing project artifacts. These tools
    provide AI assistants with the ability to discover what initiatives,
    milestones, and issues exist in a project, with filtering and sorting
    capabilities to help navigate large project structures efficiently.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "listIssues tool returns filtered list of issues with metadata"
    - "listMilestones tool returns milestone summaries with status"
    - "listInitiatives tool provides high-level project overview"
    - "Supports filtering by status, priority, assignee, and other criteria"
    - "Provides sorting options (by date, priority, status, etc.)"
    - "Returns concise but useful information for each artifact"

notes: |
  These discovery tools help AI assistants understand project scope
  and structure before diving into specific context. Essential for
  navigation and project understanding.
