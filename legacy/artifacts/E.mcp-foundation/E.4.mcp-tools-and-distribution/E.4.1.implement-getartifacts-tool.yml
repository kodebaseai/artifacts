  summary: >
    Create MCP tool for querying and retrieving artifact information. This tool
    allows AI assistants to request specific artifacts by ID, search for
    artifacts by criteria, and retrieve detailed information about initiatives,
    milestones, and issues with full metadata and relationship information.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Supports querying artifacts by ID (exact match)"
    - "Supports searching artifacts by title, content, or metadata"
    - "Returns complete artifact information including relationships"
    - "Handles invalid artifact IDs gracefully with helpful errors"
    - "Respects security constraints and path validation"
    - "Provides consistent JSON response format"

notes: |
  This is the primary tool for accessing individual artifacts. Must be
  robust and provide comprehensive information while maintaining security
  and performance standards.
