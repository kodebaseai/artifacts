  summary: >
    Create MCP tool for comprehensive context retrieval with filtering. This is
    the primary tool that AI assistants will use to understand project context.
    It combines artifact data, documentation, event history, and relevant files
    into a coherent context package optimized for AI consumption.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Provides comprehensive context for specific artifacts or queries"
    - "Applies intelligent filtering based on relevance and relationships"
    - "Respects context size limits and provides truncation metadata"
    - "Includes relevant documentation and file references"
    - "Formats response optimally for AI assistant understanding"
    - "Supports different context levels (minimal, standard, comprehensive)"

notes: |
  This is the flagship tool that delivers the core value proposition of
  the MCP server. It must integrate all the context gathering and filtering
  capabilities built in previous milestones.
