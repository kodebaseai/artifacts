  vision: >
    Build the Git operations package that provides the automation layer between
    Git actions and artifact state changes. This package implements the core Git
    hooks, branch management, and PR automation that makes the Kodebase
    methodology seamless within existing Git workflows. It transforms manual Git
    operations into intelligent, event-driven updates that maintain perfect
    synchronization between development work and project knowledge.
  scope: >
    This initiative focuses on building the @kodebase/git-ops package with all
    Git automation capabilities. Includes: Git hooks implementation, branch
    management utilities, PR automation, commit validation, and event detection.
    Excludes: CLI commands (Initiative D), artifact parsing (Initiative B), MCP
    integration, web interface.
  success_criteria:
    - All Git hooks working reliably on Mac/Linux (Windows support future)
    - Seamless integration with GitHub workflows (GitLab/Bitbucket for future)
    - Zero manual status updates required during normal development
    - Branch operations automatically trigger correct status transitions
    - Published to npm as @kodebase/git-ops

completion_summary:
  business_impact: "Established the foundational Git automation infrastructure
    that enables seamless integration between Git workflows and artifact
    management. The @kodebase/git-ops package provides the critical automation
    layer that makes the Kodebase methodology practical and effortless for
    developers, eliminating manual status updates and ensuring perfect
    synchronization between development work and project tracking."
  strategic_achievements:
    - "Built comprehensive Git hooks system with post-checkout, post-merge, and
      pre-push automation"
    - "Implemented bidirectional synchronization between PR states and artifact
      events"
    - "Created intelligent branch management with automatic artifact status
      transitions"
    - "Established PR automation with context-aware template generation and LLM
      guidance"
    - "Delivered cross-platform compatibility for Mac/Linux environments"
    - "Published @kodebase/git-ops package to npm for ecosystem availability"
  organizational_learning:
    - "Git automation is the cornerstone of methodology adoption"
    - "Without seamless integration between Git operations and artifact
      management, methodology becomes a burden"
    - "Automation must be invisible to developers - enhance existing workflows
      without requiring behavior changes"
    - "Context-driven approaches (like LLM-guided PR descriptions) are more
      flexible than rigid template systems"
  architecture_evolution:
    - "Git-ops package establishes event-driven architecture pattern essential
      for future CLI and MCP integrations"
    - "Separation of concerns between Git operations, artifact management, and
      user interfaces creates clean foundation"
    - "Architecture provides foundation for next phase of tooling development"
  future_roadmap_impact:
    - "Initiative C completion unblocks all downstream initiatives (D, E, F, H)
      by providing core automation infrastructure"
    - "CLI initiative (D) can now focus on user experience rather than
      foundational Git operations"
    - "Established patterns and architecture will accelerate development of
      remaining initiatives significantly"

notes:
  testing_strategy: >
    Use memfs (in-memory file system) to test Git hook operations, file
    modifications, and artifact updates without actual disk I/O. This enables
    testing of .git/hooks installation, branch operations, and cross-platform
    path handling in isolated environments. Combined with git fixtures, provides
    comprehensive test coverage.
