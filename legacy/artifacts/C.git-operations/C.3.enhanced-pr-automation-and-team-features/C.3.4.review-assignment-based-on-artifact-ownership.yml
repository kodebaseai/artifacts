  summary: >
    Automatically assign PR reviewers based on artifact ownership, team
    structure, and expertise areas. Use artifact metadata (assignee, created_by)
    and team configuration to intelligently suggest and assign appropriate
    reviewers for maximum review quality and efficiency.

  problem_statement: >
    Manual reviewer assignment is time-consuming and often suboptimal. Team
    members most familiar with an artifact's context should review related PRs,
    but this knowledge isn't leveraged in current PR workflows. Automatic
    assignment based on artifact ownership can improve review quality.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - Automatic reviewer assignment based on artifact assignee/creator
    - Team-based assignment using CODEOWNERS-style configuration
    - Expertise-based assignment considering artifact types and domains
    - Fallback assignment rules for unavailable or unassigned artifacts
    - Manual override capabilities for special cases
    - Integration with existing GitHub reviewer assignment mechanisms

  deliverables:
    - Intelligent reviewer assignment system
    - Team configuration and CODEOWNERS integration
    - Expertise mapping and domain-based assignment
    - Assignment rules engine with configurable logic
    - GitHub API integration for reviewer management
    - Documentation for team configuration and assignment rules

  technical_notes: >
    Extend the PR automation to analyze artifact metadata and determine
    appropriate reviewers. Implement a configurable rules engine that considers
    artifact assignee, creator, team membership, and expertise areas. Integrate
    with GitHub's reviewer assignment API and support both automatic assignment
    and suggested reviewers.

  validation:
    - Reviewers automatically assigned based on artifact ownership
    - Team configuration correctly influences assignment decisions
    - Expertise mapping works for different artifact types
    - Fallback rules handle edge cases appropriately
    - Manual overrides function correctly
    - GitHub integration assigns reviewers successfully
