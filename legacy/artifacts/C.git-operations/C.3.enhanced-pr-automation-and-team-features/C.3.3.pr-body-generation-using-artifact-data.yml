content:
  summary: >
    Generate intelligent and comprehensive PR descriptions using artifact
    metadata including deliverables, acceptance criteria, dependencies, progress
    status, and related context. Create templates that provide meaningful
    information for reviewers and stakeholders.

  problem_statement: >
    Current PR descriptions are often minimal or manually written, lacking
    structured information about what the PR accomplishes, how it relates to
    project goals, and what reviewers should focus on. Automated generation can
    provide consistent, comprehensive context for better reviews.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - PR bodies automatically generated from artifact metadata
    - Include deliverables, acceptance criteria, and validation points
    - Show dependency relationships and impact analysis
    - Display progress status and milestone context
    - Support different templates for issues vs milestones vs initiatives
    - Allow manual overrides and customization of generated content

  deliverables:
    - Intelligent PR body generation system
    - Template engine with multiple formats (issue, milestone, initiative)
    - Metadata extraction and formatting utilities
    - Dependency visualization in PR descriptions
    - Progress tracking and completion status display
    - Customizable templates with organization-specific branding

  technical_notes: >
    Build on the enhanced PR templates from C.3.1 to create a sophisticated
    generation system. Use @kodebase/core parsers to extract all relevant
    metadata, format it using configurable templates, and generate structured PR
    descriptions. Support markdown formatting, dependency graphs, progress bars,
    and checklist generation based on acceptance criteria.

  validation:
    - Generated PR bodies include all relevant artifact information
    - Templates adapt correctly to different artifact types
    - Dependency relationships are clearly visualized
    - Progress status is accurately reflected
    - Generated content is well-formatted and readable
    - Manual customization options work as expected
