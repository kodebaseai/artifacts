  summary: >
    Extend the existing PR automation with advanced team coordination features.
    The basic GitHub integration exists but needs enhancement with artifact
    context, template generation, and bidirectional status synchronization.
    Focus on making PR workflows intelligent and artifact-aware.
  deliverables:
    - Enhanced PR templates with artifact context injection
    - Bidirectional status sync between PRs and artifacts
    - PR body generation using artifact data
    - Review assignment based on artifact ownership
    - PR milestone tracking and progress reporting
  validation:
    - PR descriptions automatically include artifact details
    - PR status changes update artifact states
    - Artifact updates reflect in PR conversations
    - Team coordination features work across repositories

  key_achievements:
    - "Enhanced PR templates with artifact context injection implemented"
    - "Bidirectional status synchronization between PRs and artifacts
      established"
    - "PR context generation system with LLM guidance templates created"
    - "Workflow coordination features for team collaboration integrated"
  strategic_decisions:
    - "Focused on context generation over static body generation due to
      methodology changes"
    - "Cancelled C.3.3, C.3.4, C.3.5 as context system handles these
      requirements"
    - "Prioritized LLM-guided PR descriptions over template-based generation"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Context-driven PR workflows are more flexible than static templates"
    - "Methodology evolution made some PR automation features redundant"
    - "LLM guidance templates provide better PR descriptions than rigid
      templates"
    - "Bidirectional sync enables artifact-aware PR workflows"
  team_impact:
    - "Streamlined PR workflow with better artifact integration and context
      awareness"
  next_milestone_insights:
    - "Future PR enhancements should focus on context quality over feature
      quantity"

notes:
  implementation_priority: >
    Start with enhanced PR templates that inject artifact context into PR
    descriptions. Then implement bidirectional status synchronization. Focus on
    PR body generation using artifact data and review assignment features.
    Finally, add milestone tracking and progress reporting.
