  summary: >
    Track PR progress in relation to milestones and initiatives. Provide
    comprehensive progress reporting that shows how individual PRs contribute to
    larger goals, milestone completion status, and overall initiative progress
    with visual dashboards and automated reporting.

  problem_statement: >
    Individual PRs exist in isolation without clear connection to milestone
    progress and initiative goals. Teams lack visibility into how code changes
    relate to project completion. Progress reporting should connect PR-level
    work to higher-level objectives with clear metrics and tracking.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - PR progress automatically tracked against related milestones
    - Visual progress indicators showing milestone completion status
    - Initiative-level reporting aggregating milestone and PR data
    - Automated progress reports with completion metrics
    - Integration with existing @kodebase/core analytics and metrics
    - Dashboard views for team and stakeholder consumption

  deliverables:
    - PR-to-milestone tracking system
    - Progress visualization and dashboard components
    - Automated progress reporting with configurable schedules
    - Integration with @kodebase/core analytics metrics
    - Milestone completion prediction and timeline estimates
    - Export capabilities for external reporting and dashboards

  technical_notes: >
    Leverage the existing @kodebase/core analytics and metrics system to track
    PR progress. Build reporting dashboards that aggregate PR data into
    milestone and initiative views. Use the bidirectional sync from C.3.2 to
    maintain accurate progress tracking. Implement prediction algorithms based
    on historical velocity and current progress.

  validation:
    - PRs correctly associated with milestones and initiatives
    - Progress tracking accurately reflects completion status
    - Visual dashboards provide clear milestone progress indicators
    - Automated reports generate on schedule with accurate data
    - Integration with core analytics functions properly
    - Progress predictions are reasonably accurate based on historical data
