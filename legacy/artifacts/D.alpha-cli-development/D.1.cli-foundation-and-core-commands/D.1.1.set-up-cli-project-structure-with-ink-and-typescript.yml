  summary: >
    Initialize the @kodebase/cli package with Ink (React for CLIs) and
    TypeScript. Set up the project structure, build system, and basic command
    framework that will serve as the foundation for all CLI commands. This
    includes configuring the development environment and establishing patterns
    for command implementation.

  problem_statement: >
    The CLI needs a solid foundation using modern tools. Ink provides a
    React-based approach to building terminal UIs, which will enable rich
    interactive features. TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer
    experience. We need proper build configuration and a scalable command
    structure.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - "@kodebase/cli package initialized in packages directory"
    - "TypeScript configuration set up with strict mode"
    - "Ink React framework installed and configured"
    - "Basic command structure established (commander.js or yargs)"
    - "Build system configured with tsup"
    - "Development scripts added (dev, build, test)"
    - "Basic CLI entry point working with 'kodebase' command"

  deliverables:
    - Initialize @kodebase/cli package
    - Configure TypeScript and build system
    - Set up Ink React framework
    - Create basic command structure
    - Add commander.js or yargs for argument parsing

  technical_notes: >
    Use tsup for building as it's already used in other packages. Configure
    TypeScript with strict mode and ES2022 target. Set up Ink with its testing
    utilities for future test implementation. Choose commander.js for its
    simplicity and wide adoption. Structure commands in a modular way to support
    future additions.

  validation:
    - Running 'pnpm build' in CLI package produces dist output
    - TypeScript compiles without errors
    - Basic 'kodebase --version' command works
    - Ink components render in terminal
    - Command structure supports adding new commands easily

notes:
  implementation_approach: >
    Start by creating the package.json with necessary dependencies. Set up
    TypeScript configuration extending from @kodebase/typescript-config. Create
    the basic file structure: src/index.ts as entry point, src/commands/ for
    command modules, src/components/ for Ink UI components. Use commander.js for
    parsing and Ink for rendering.
