  summary: >
    Add command aliases and shortcuts to improve CLI user experience. Implement
    'kb' as a global alias for 'kodebase' and create shortcut commands like 'kb
    s' for status, 'kb c' for create, etc. This makes the CLI more convenient
    for daily use.

  description: >
    The CLI currently requires typing the full 'kodebase' command name, which is
    verbose for frequent usage. This issue implements a comprehensive alias
    system that allows users to use 'kb' as a shortcut and provides common
    command shortcuts.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - kb command works as drop-in replacement for 'kodebase'
    - Shortcut commands work - 'kb s' (status), 'kb c' (create), 'kb l' (list)
    - Aliases are registered with package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn)
    - Help system shows available shortcuts and aliases
    - Aliases work across different shell environments (bash, zsh, fish)
    - Error messages mention both full and short command forms

  technical_approach: >
    Add alias registration to package.json bin field, create wrapper scripts for
    shortcuts, update help system to display aliases, ensure command parsing
    handles both full and short forms consistently.

  files_affected:
    - packages/cli/package.json (bin field updates)
    - packages/cli/src/cli.ts (command parsing)
    - packages/cli/src/commands/*.ts (help text updates)

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Complex command mapping with Commander.js subcommands - rejected for
      simplicity"
    - "Shell-level aliases via install scripts - rejected as it's too invasive"
    - "Simple string replacement approach - chosen for MVP simplicity and
      reliability"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "TypeScript complained about undefined command parameter when
        resolving shortcuts"
      solution: "Added null check with explicit type guard before accessing command
        shortcut mapping"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights: "Simple string mapping proved most effective - aliases should be
    transparent to users and maintainable for developers"
  implementation_approach: "Added 'kb' binary to package.json, created command
    shortcut mapping object in App.tsx, updated all help text with alias
    information"
  knowledge_generated: "Package manager binaries automatically work across all
    shell environments, npm/pnpm/yarn handle this seamlessly without
    shell-specific configuration"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified 'kb --help' shows same output as 'kodebase --help' with alias
      information"
    - "Tested 'kb s', 'kb c', 'kb l' shortcuts work identically to full commands"
    - "Confirmed error messages include both full and short command forms"
    - "Validated help examples show both 'kodebase' and 'kb' usage patterns"

notes:
  implementation_details: >
    Should integrate cleanly with existing Commander.js structure. Consider
    creating a mapping system for shortcuts to full commands to avoid code
    duplication.

  validation_approach: >
    Test alias installation with different package managers, verify shortcuts
    work in multiple shell environments, confirm help system accuracy.
