  summary: >
    Build an interactive wizard for artifact creation using the existing Ink
    components. Guide users through a multi-step process with validation, making
    artifact creation intuitive and error-free.

  description: >
    Currently, artifact creation requires understanding the YAML schema and
    manual file editing. This wizard provides a guided experience that walks
    users through each field, validates inputs in real-time, and generates
    properly formatted artifacts. This improves onboarding and reduces errors.

  acceptance_criteria:
    - Interactive wizard launched via 'kodebase create --wizard' or 'kb create
      --wizard'
    - Multi-step flow: type selection → basic info → details → relationships
    - Uses existing Ink TextInput for title, assignee, description fields
    - Uses existing Ink Select for type, priority, estimation options
    - Live validation with helpful error messages and hints
    - Back/forward navigation between steps with arrow keys or commands
    - Preview final artifact before creation
    - Confirmation step before writing to filesystem
    - Supports creating initiatives, milestones, and issues

  technical_approach: >
    Build React components using existing Ink infrastructure. Create step
    management system with navigation controls. Integrate with existing artifact
    utilities and validation from D.2. Use existing UI components and styling
    patterns.

  files_affected:
    - packages/cli/src/commands/create.ts (add --wizard option)
    - packages/cli/src/components/wizard/ (new wizard components)
    - packages/cli/src/utils/wizard.ts (wizard logic and validation)
    - packages/cli/src/components/wizard/Steps.tsx (step management)

notes:
  implementation_details: >
    Should reuse existing artifact creation logic and validation from D.2.
    Leverage existing UI components (TextInput, Select, etc.) for consistency.
    Consider step state management and validation feedback patterns.

  validation_approach: >
    Test wizard flow for all artifact types, verify validation accuracy, confirm
    generated artifacts match manual creation, test navigation and error
    recovery.

  design_considerations: >
    Should feel consistent with existing CLI UI patterns. Consider providing
    sensible defaults and shortcuts for power users while maintaining guidance
    for new users.
