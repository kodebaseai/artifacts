        business_impact: Production-ready CLI enabling structured development
          methodology adoption

content:
  vision: >
    Build the Kodebase CLI tool that brings the methodology to life through
    intuitive commands. This is the primary interface for developers to interact
    with the artifact system, automating the manual processes validated in
    Initiative A. The CLI transforms the theoretical methodology into practical,
    daily workflow commands that make structured knowledge management
    effortless.
  scope: >
    This initiative focuses on building the @kodebase/cli package with essential
    artifact lifecycle commands. Includes: Core commands (create, status, ready,
    list), Git branch automation, interactive prompts, and basic workflow
    automation. Excludes: Git hooks (Initiative D), MCP integration, advanced
    analytics, migration tools, and plugin system.
  success_criteria:
    - All core commands working reliably with <100ms response time
    - Intuitive command structure that feels natural to developers
    - Comprehensive help system and error messages
    - Published to npm as @kodebase/cli
    - Zero-friction installation and setup process

completion_summary:
  business_impact: >
    The Kodebase CLI transforms theoretical methodology into practical daily
    workflow tools, enabling developers to adopt structured knowledge management
    without friction. This creates a scalable foundation for broader adoption of
    the Kodebase methodology, directly supporting the business goal of making
    structured development practices accessible and actionable.
  strategic_achievements:
    - "Production-ready CLI with 15+ commands covering complete artifact
      lifecycle"
    - "Comprehensive Git workflow integration enabling seamless branch and PR
      management"
    - "Interactive user experience with wizards, fuzzy search, and intuitive
      shortcuts"
    - "World-class onboarding system including setup wizard and interactive
      tutorial"
    - "Distribution-ready npm package with global installation and shell
      completion"
    - "Robust architecture supporting future extensions and MCP integration"
  organizational_learning:
    - "Ink.js framework provides excellent foundation for interactive CLI
      development"
    - "TypeScript + testing with memfs enables reliable CLI testing without file
      system dependencies"
    - "Progressive enhancement approach (core → git → UX → distribution)
      prevents over-engineering"
    - "User experience design principles apply strongly to CLI tools, not just
      web interfaces"
    - "Documentation and onboarding are critical success factors for developer
      tool adoption"
    - "MVP methodology prevents feature creep while ensuring comprehensive
      functionality"
  architecture_evolution:
    - "Established modular CLI architecture with clear separation between
      commands, utilities, and UI"
    - "Created reusable patterns for interactive CLI components (wizards,
      pickers, progress indicators)"
    - "Built extensible command system with plugin-ready architecture for future
      enhancements"
    - "Integrated @kodebase/core and @kodebase/git-ops packages into cohesive
      CLI experience"
    - "Developed comprehensive testing strategies for CLI applications with
      complex user interactions"
    - "Established distribution and packaging patterns for npm-published CLI
      tools"
  future_roadmap_impact:
    - "CLI provides foundation for MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration in
      future initiatives"
    - "User feedback from distributed CLI will inform future methodology and
      tooling improvements"
    - "Established patterns enable rapid development of additional CLI commands
      and features"
    - "Distribution infrastructure supports broader community adoption and
      contribution"
    - "Architecture supports future integrations with IDEs, CI/CD systems, and
      other developer tools"

notes:
  testing_strategy: >
    Use memfs for testing all file operations without actual disk I/O. Mock
    @kodebase/git-ops for testing Git integration. Test interactive features
    using Ink's testing utilities. Ensure all commands work in CI environments
    without TTY. Test error scenarios with malformed artifacts and missing
    files.

  onboarding_strategy: >
    Implement an interactive tutorial accessible via 'kodebase tutorial' that
    guides new users through creating their first artifact, understanding the
    lifecycle, and completing a simple issue. The tutorial uses a sandbox
    environment to avoid affecting real work. Success metric: users complete
    first real issue within 5 minutes of installation.

  future_integration_hooks: >
    Design CLI architecture with extension points for future MCP integration.
    Placeholder commands like 'kodebase context' reserved for MCP features.
    Plugin system groundwork allowing additional commands to be registered.
    Configuration system designed to accommodate MCP server settings later.
