  summary: >
    Create comprehensive documentation suite for @kodebase/cli to ensure smooth
    onboarding and successful usage. This includes installation guides, quick
    start tutorials, complete API reference, and troubleshooting documentation
    that enables users to succeed within 5 minutes.
  description: >
    With the CLI functionality complete, users need clear documentation to
    discover, install, and effectively use the tool. This documentation serves
    as the primary resource for new users and should guide them from discovery
    through their first successful workflow.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Installation guide covering npm, yarn, and pnpm package managers
    - Environment-specific setup instructions (macOS, Linux, Windows)
    - Quick start guide with common workflow examples
    - Complete API reference documenting all commands and options
    - Troubleshooting section addressing common installation and usage issues
    - Command examples with expected outputs for clarity
    - Documentation is accessible and well-structured
    - Links to tutorial system and additional resources
  technical_requirements:
    - Create packages/cli/README.md as main documentation entry point
    - Document global installation process for each package manager
    - Provide step-by-step first workflow example
    - Document all CLI commands with syntax and examples
    - Include common error scenarios and solutions
    - Add links to shell completion setup instructions
    - Document configuration options and environment variables
    - Create troubleshooting flowchart for common issues
  validation_steps:
    - Documentation is clear and actionable for new users
    - All command examples work as documented
    - Installation instructions tested on different environments
    - Troubleshooting guides resolve real user issues
    - Documentation supports the "<5 minutes to success" goal

development_process:
  implementation_approach: >
    Approached the documentation as a comprehensive user guide, structuring it
    to support the "<5 minutes to success" goal. Started with a clear table of
    contents for easy navigation, then built each section to progressively guide
    users from installation through advanced usage. Used real command examples
    with expected outputs throughout.
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Separate documentation files per command (rejected for single-file
      simplicity)"
    - "Minimal quick reference only (rejected as insufficient for new users)"
    - "Wiki-style documentation (rejected to keep docs versioned with code)"
    - "Generated API docs only (rejected as lacking context and examples)"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Balancing comprehensive coverage with readability"
      solution: "Used collapsible sections and clear hierarchy with table of contents"
    - challenge: "Documenting commands that are still evolving"
      solution: "Focused on stable command interfaces and patterns"
    - challenge: "Making troubleshooting section genuinely helpful"
      solution: "Anticipated real issues based on common npm/Git problems"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "Documentation structure directly impacts user success rate"
    - "Real command examples with output are worth more than abstract
      descriptions"
    - "Troubleshooting section needs to address actual pain points, not
      theoretical issues"
    - "Progressive disclosure helps manage complexity without overwhelming new
      users"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Created single comprehensive README.md following industry best practices"
    - "Structured content to support quick scanning and deep reading"
    - "Included platform-specific instructions for broad accessibility"
    - "Added advanced usage section for power users without cluttering basics"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "The importance of testing documentation by actually running commands"
    - "How to structure CLI documentation for different user personas"
    - "The value of anticipating common issues in troubleshooting guides"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified all CLI commands work as documented using local build"
    - "Tested installation instructions conceptually (would work with published
      package)"
    - "Validated command outputs match documentation"
    - "Ensured all links and references are accurate"

notes:
  context: >
    The CLI has sophisticated features (aliases, completion, interactive
    components) that need clear explanation. Users should understand both basic
    usage and advanced features without overwhelming complexity.
  implementation_approach: >
    Start with README.md covering installation and quick start. Add
    comprehensive command reference with examples. Create troubleshooting
    section based on likely user scenarios. Focus on clarity and actionability
    over completeness.
  documentation_structure: >
    1. Installation (multiple package managers) 2. Quick Start (first workflow
    in <5 minutes) 3. Command Reference (all commands with examples) 4. Shell
    Integration (completion, aliases) 5. Troubleshooting (common issues and
    solutions) 6. Advanced Usage (workflows, tips, integrations)
