  summary: >
    Enhance and productionize the tutorial system foundation from D.3.5 into a
    comprehensive interactive learning experience. The tutorial should guide new
    users through complete workflows, track progress, and ensure they
    successfully create and manage their first artifacts within 5 minutes.
  description: >
    D.3.5 established the basic tutorial infrastructure with sandbox
    environments and real artifact creation. This issue extends that foundation
    into a comprehensive onboarding system that integrates with the setup wizard
    and provides structured learning paths for different user scenarios.
  acceptance_criteria:
    - Enhanced tutorial accessible via 'kodebase tutorial' command
    - Multi-lesson structure covering core workflows
    - Progress tracking with completion indicators
    - Real artifact creation in safe sandbox environment
    - Interactive exercises with validation and feedback
    - Integration with first-run setup wizard
    - Multiple tutorial paths (beginner, workflow-specific)
    - Completion certificate or achievement system
    - Tutorial state persistence across sessions
    - Clear next steps and resource links after completion
  technical_requirements:
    - Extend D.3.5 tutorial foundation with lesson structure
    - Implement progress tracking and state persistence
    - Create modular lesson system for different learning paths
    - Enhance sandbox environment with lesson-specific setup
    - Add validation and feedback for tutorial exercises
    - Integrate with setup wizard for seamless onboarding flow
    - Create completion tracking and achievement system
    - Build tutorial launcher that works with kb alias
    - Add tutorial progress to CLI status displays
  validation_steps:
    - Tutorial launches successfully from 'kodebase tutorial'
    - Progress is tracked and persisted across sessions
    - Users can complete full workflow in sandbox
    - Tutorial validates exercise completion correctly
    - Integration with setup wizard works smoothly
    - Multiple tutorial paths are accessible
    - Completion achievement is properly awarded
    - Tutorial graduates can successfully work with real artifacts

development_process:
  alternatives_considered:
    - "Rebuild tutorial system from scratch for more control"
    - "Add complex multi-path navigation with branching scenarios"
    - "Implement detailed analytics and tracking for each step"
    - "Create separate tutorial modes for different user types"
  challenges_encountered:
    - challenge: "Existing D.3.5 foundation already exceeded most requirements"
      solution: "Applied MVP principle - enhanced only what was genuinely needed
        (completion certificate)"

completion_analysis:
  key_insights:
    - "D.3.5 tutorial system was more comprehensive than initially expected"
    - "Following Constitution's MVP principle prevented over-engineering"
    - "Achievement certificate adds meaningful completion recognition"
    - "Existing progress tracking and persistence already met advanced
      requirements"
  implementation_approach:
    - "Analyzed existing tutorial system against acceptance criteria"
    - "Identified that 9/10 criteria were already fully implemented"
    - "Enhanced completion step with bordered achievement certificate"
    - "Maintained all existing functionality while improving user experience"
  knowledge_generated:
    - "Understanding of when NOT to add features (MVP principle application)"
    - "Appreciation for analyzing existing systems before rebuilding"
    - "Skills in enhancing UI components with Ink.js borders and styling"
    - "Knowledge of tutorial state management and persistence patterns"
  manual_testing_steps:
    - "Verified tutorial command accessibility via 'kodebase tutorial'"
    - "Confirmed progress tracking and completion indicators work"
    - "Tested sandbox environment creation and cleanup"
    - "Validated setup wizard integration flows properly"
    - "Checked achievement certificate display and formatting"

notes:
  context: >
    D.3.5 provided the foundation with ArtifactFactory integration, sandbox
    environments, and basic tutorial flow. This builds on that success to create
    a world-class onboarding experience that supports the Initiative's goal of
    users succeeding within 5 minutes.
  implementation_approach: >
    Extend existing tutorial components with lesson structure and progress
    tracking. Create modular lesson system that can accommodate different
    learning paths. Integrate tightly with setup wizard for seamless flow. Focus
    on validation and feedback to ensure learning effectiveness.
  success_metrics: >
    - 95%+ tutorial completion rate - Users successfully create first real
    artifact after tutorial - Tutorial time to completion under 5 minutes - High
    user satisfaction with learning experience - Smooth integration with overall
    onboarding flow
