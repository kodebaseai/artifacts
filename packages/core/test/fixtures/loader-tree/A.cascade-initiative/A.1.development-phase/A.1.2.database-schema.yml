  summary: "Design and implement the database schema with proper indexing, relationships, and migrations."
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "Create entity-relationship diagram"
    - "Define database tables with proper constraints"
    - "Add necessary indexes for query performance"
    - "Create migration scripts"
implementation_notes:
  result: "Schema implemented with normalized tables, composite indexes, and migration scripts"
  challenges:
    - challenge: "Query performance degradation with large datasets"
      solution: "Added composite indexes on frequently queried column combinations"
  insights:
    - "Using partial indexes for status columns reduced index size by 40%"
    - "Migration rollback strategy essential for zero-downtime deployments"
